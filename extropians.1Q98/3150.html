Interesting paper on the theoretical level.  I used a similar technique<br>
in 1984 to simulate allow dumb asni terminals to enter clear-text<br>
passwords without the passwords appearing over the network clear text. <br>
It was not encryption, but added enough garbage going to and from the<br>
dumb terminal from the host, that only the host could easily determine<br>
which characters were typed from the user.<br>
<p>
The drawbacks to the paper you cite are:<br>
1. Huge bandwith overhead.  Adding equal amounts of chaff and real<br>
message doubles the message size.  More chaff increases it further.<br>
<p>
2.  Huge packet overhead.  Whole words or names would be visible in<br>
individual packets, unless the packets are extremely small.  The paper<br>
gives an example of 1-bit messages inside 100 bit packets.  This turns a<br>
one-minute transmission into a 100 minute transmission!  More<br>
accurately, the minimum TCP packet size is more like 100 BYTES, which<br>
would be 1000 bits over a modem (with start and stop bits).  This makes<br>
that one minute transmission time 1000 minutes, or 16 hours and 40<br>
minutes!<br>
<p>
3.  This method still includes secret authentication keys that must be<br>
exchanged between the participants and known only to them.  It would be<br>
just as easy to exchange encryption keys.  This method does not seem to<br>
add any security, does not simplify procedures or difficulties, but does<br>
greatly increases bandwith.<br>
<p>
4.  The proposal seems to be based on the idea that "encryption" is<br>
export-controlled, but this new method would not be because it is not<br>
"encryption".  The various laws I have seen do not use a scientific<br>
definition of "encryption".  They describe any means to hide, encode, or<br>
make unreadable a secret message.  I think that this form of<br>
reformatting a message to make it unreadable would be considered the<br>
same as "encryption" by government and law enforcement agencies.<br>
<p>
This seems to be a lawyer's trick to bypass export laws rather than a<br>
technical solution to securing communications.<br>
