<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Huh? Is there any evidence at all that Hypericum acts as a SSRI?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember, the SSRI family is very specific, and AFAIK not something</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I was reading an article last week that said that  Hypericum has SSRI<br>
properties, but also does one or two other things that allow for a more<br>
stable treatment, minimizing side effects. Most things in nature that<br>
work typically aren't promoted by the medical establishment because they<br>
can't patent them, and therefore make multi-millions off of them. FOr<br>
example, ginger root is typically 2-3 times more effective as a<br>
treatment for motion sickness than dramamine, but you never hear about<br>
this from the drug companies, or from your conventional doctors. Ginger<br>
is so ubiquitous that no one in the medical field can hope of making<br>
apenny on recommending it for treatment of motion sickness.<br>
