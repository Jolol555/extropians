We didn't give it our best effort, because if we did, our opponents in the international scene would use<br>
our actions as ample fodder for all sorts of negative PR about us.  Not only that but the people in<br>
Africa do NOT want our best efforts, since that also means that we will be expecting THEIR best effort.<br>
No more skimming, scamming, pillaging, and all the other easy ways to make a buck any more.<br>

They must start trying before we can...<br>
