I'm currently working on a very large futurist website that will<br>
contain information on the technology, social and political changes we<br>
can expect in the future (and don't worry, it's not all my own<br>
opinions.)  Although it will have a very transhumanist/extropian feel,<br>
I'm trying to make it as open to 'the man on the street' as possible,<br>
so the whole things one huge multimedia extravaganza (if your browser<br>
supports it, if not you get a slightly smaller multimedia<br>
extravaganza.)  I've also been trying to think of novel ways of<br>
organise the content.  The standard category/subcategory structure<br>
doesn't encourage enough exploration by people who are merely browsing<br>
(of course, it's great if you know what you're looking for so it will<br>
be an available.)  I've experimented with random content menus, but<br>
they become confusing when the user is looking for something they've<br>
just seen, but can't easily find it.  One idea I had was to organise<br>
everything over a future timeline, but giving dates for predictions<br>
isn't my favourite pastime.  One thing that did interest me was the<br>
recent discussion on organising predictions according to probability,<br>
but I've yet to think of an easy way to implement it on the web.  The<br>
basic premise of what I'm trying to do is make it a 'walk through the<br>
future' whatever that means.<br>
<p>
So if you have any ideas or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.<br>
<p>
Just to give you an idea of what it's like - the title to the cryonics<br>
page reads, "This is where you go when you die."  I'm hoping to put it<br>
on-line is a reduced format soon (i.e. a page saying "under<br>
construction" and a picture of a workman :) so I'll post the address<br>
when I do.<br>
