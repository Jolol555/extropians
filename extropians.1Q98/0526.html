    What theory are atheists rejecting?  The statement "God exists" is a <br>
null theory. What does it tell us? What can it predict? How can it even <br>
be inconsistent or compared to experimental evidence, when it tells us <br>
nothing? At least Christianity goes past "God exists" to describe further <br>
implications, as inconsistent and disagreeable as those implications might <br>
be. There's no use in entertaining a theory unless it has some describable <br>
effect. You are right, atheists cannot prove there are no gods, but the <br>
**burden of proof is not theirs**. I doubt you would complain anywhere near <br>
as much when I say that there is no small band playing in my radio. It is <br>
certainly *possible*, within the laws of physics, that hitherto-unknown small <br>
people of Earth occupy my radio, and are now playing a stunning variety of <br>
modern music, but it is so unlikely that I feel entirely rational when I say <br>
that it is not occurring... but that's just a closed-minded atheist talking.<br>
<p>
    Do a websearch for "James Randi" or "Occam's Razor" sometime.<br>
