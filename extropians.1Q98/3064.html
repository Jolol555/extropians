Based on the non sequitur responses I got, I don't think my posting was<br>
very clear.  Let me try again.  I know how to use my individual software so<br>
as to not disrupt the List.  As a Network and Security Engineer, my<br>
question is why we have configured this List so that every Netscape and<br>
Eudora e-mail client has a button on their tool-bar that will disrupt this<br>
List?  Do we really think the solution is warn all the List participants to<br>
"never push this button"?<br>
<p>
Netscape and Eudora mailers have toolbars that contain two reply buttons.<br>
One button is a "Reply-to-All" button which replies to the list and to all<br>
particpants (sender, receiver, cc'd persons) to make sure they get copies.<br>
This keeps participants who are not on the mailing List from getting<br>
dropped from future discussion.  The Other button is a "Reply-to-Single"<br>
button that will only reply to the List only. This button drops<br>
participants who are not on the mailing list from future discussion.  Both<br>
of these buttons are available at all times, and the user can always hit<br>
either one.  We cannot control which button a user hits to reply.  Some<br>
people have suggested setting the "defaults" in the e-mail client, but<br>
these defaults only set which function key calls which button.  Both<br>
buttons are always available on the toolbar and the users who use the<br>
buttons still have to remember which one to hit for this List.  There is no<br>
way to restrict the software to only type of reply.<br>
<p>
The Extropians List is set up so that only one of these Reply buttons will<br>
work as expected with no side effects.  The user cannot choose what kind of<br>
reply to use.  Only one button will produce a single posting, whereas the<br>
other button will trigger a cascade of duplicate postings for any followups<br>
to the message.   Control for who should be included in the reply is<br>
restricted by the centralized List software and is not left to the user.<br>
The centralized List software requires specific choices from the end user<br>
if it is to function correctly.  If the end user makes the wrong choices,<br>
the entire List will suffer the disruptions in future posts.  The reason<br>
for this is that this List advertises itself in the headers as being two<br>
"extropians" lists, one at "extropy.com" and one at "extropy.org".  When a<br>
user tries to Reply-to-All, they send copies to both of these Lists, which<br>
both go to the same destination.<br>
<p>
Other Lists are setup in a way that either Reply button will work as<br>
expected with no side effects.  The user can choose what kind of reply to<br>
use.  Both buttons work, and the List always gets one and only one posting.<br>
Control for who should be included in the reply is left to the user.  The<br>
centralized List software does not require any specific choices for the end<br>
user.  The reason for this is that most lists have a single name only.<br>
They are only listed under one name in the headers, so there is one and<br>
only one reply to the List in any case.<br>
<p>
Do we desire to be set up so only one Reply button will work?  Is there a<br>
reason why we don't want this List set up like other Lists so that either<br>
button will work?  Do we want to make the user's choice not disruptive in<br>
either case?  Or do we want to allow every List participant to have a<br>
button on their desktop that can disrupt the List on every single message?<br>
<p>
Do the benefits of calling this List both "extropians@extropy.com" and<br>
"extropians@extropy.org" outweigh the annoyance of the duplicate messages?<br>
