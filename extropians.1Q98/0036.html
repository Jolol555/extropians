Hi,<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Mobile phones are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; useful in this regard, and I suppose eventually very very small video</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cameras will be built into phones, which would be a great way to record</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; evidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a good point. The MIT wearable group have suggested that</i><br>
<i>&gt; wearable computers with video cameras make a good crime deterrent (and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think somebody suggested on this list, last time the subject came</i><br>
<i>&gt; up, that if you show signs of high anxiety level and stand still, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wearable will start transmitting pictures automatically to people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; might call the police for you if you are robbed). </i><br>
<p>
This is an excellent idea, although it could be embarrassing if the wearer<br>
was trying to chat someone up  :-/<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; David Brin had</i><br>
<i>&gt; glasses with a similar function in _Earth_ (and old people driving</i><br>
<i>&gt; teenagers nuts by *watching* them intently). </i><br>
<p>
Scared old people spamming the police with live video feeds? Who would have<br>
thought of it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Overall, the mobile phone is already transforming our society</i><br>
<i>&gt; immensely in unexpected directions.</i><br>
<p>
Some areas much more so than others, but it is definitely having a<br>
noticeable impact, almost as great an impact as telephones, I suppose.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not all defenses against violence need to be direct counter-violence,</i><br>
<p>
Nope, but other than *really* good armour (my preferred solution) it's<br>
about the only last resort of any use against anything larger than a duck.<br>
<p>
If the victim was armoured effectively it could be quite amusing to be set<br>
upon, but with armour anything less than 99.9% effective an attack can be a<br>
cause for concern.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; although surveillance is hardly a solution to all forms of violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; either; the local transport company here in Stockholm has recently</i><br>
<i>&gt; fielded a new model of subway cars with video cameras, in order to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make people feel more "secure". But the events that make people the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most insecure usually involve drunk or drugged offenders which most</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely are not rational enough to worry about surveillance cameras.</i><br>
<p>
Or rapid attacks.  There are plenty of instances where the aggressors flee<br>
the scene before help arrives, in instances like this it might be able to<br>
identify the attackers and have them suitably punished, but that is of<br>
little comfort while the attack is taking place, I'm sure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In general, a more well-connected social network seems to be both</i><br>
<i>&gt; psychologically healthy and gives better security (not necessarily</i><br>
<i>&gt; along the lines "If you hit me, I'll tell my friend Don</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fettuchini...", but it helps :-). This is an area where social</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology (like mobile phones, wearables etc) might come in handy.</i><br>
<p>
Holding a phone up and saying eight of your friends live one block around<br>
the corner, and your finger is on the "dial" button, can be a useful<br>
deterrent sometimes.<br>
<p>
