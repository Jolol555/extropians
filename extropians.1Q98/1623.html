&lt;&lt;You don't mention if you've done the exercises or not. If you do all<br>
the exercises you will be even more impressed. Two other excellent<br>
books for playing around with your viewpoint are _Shaving the Inside<br>
of Your Skull_ by Mel Ash and _Undoing Yourself_ by Christopher<br>
Hyatt.&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Estacado:  please tell me more about Mel Ash!<br>
<p>
I have practiced most of the exersizes in Prometheus rising.  But the <br>
most powerful (non-drug) technique I have yet for metaprogramming is <br>
Christopher Hyatt's "Undoing Yourself".<br>
<p>
Having practiced his techniques for more than 7 years now, I have yet to <br>
find any more powerful.  I have however refined his techniques <br>
SUBSTANTIALLY.  I can now "energize" myself at any time or place I want, <br>
regardless of what I'm doing.  It's ability to reduce or eliminate <br>
anxiety and other pesky neurosies always amazes me.<br>
<p>
Over the last 5 years, I have taught over 200 people my particular <br>
technique, so anyone wishing to find out more, please feel free to <br>
e-mail me.<br>
