<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;thinking of a free market capitalist. In his view, humans have </i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Please.  Surely you don't really believe this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Beleive what? That  a person should have to demonstrate a minimum </i><br>
<i>&gt;fiscal</i><br>
<i>&gt;capacity before being allowed to reproduce? </i><br>
<p>
How did you get this?  I was under the impression that Mr. Moeller<br>
was saying that free market advocates spouse slavery; that is, <br>
that people are merely consumer goods.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;While one could say this </i><br>
<i>&gt;is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;unreasonable imposition on the individuals rights to procreate, I say </i><br>
<i>&gt;that</i><br>
<i>&gt;my being forced by government, society, and my own concience, to </i><br>
<i>&gt;support the</i><br>
<i>&gt;abandoned products of irresponsible reproduction is an unreasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;impostion on my privacy, my personal productivity, and my rights to </i><br>
<i>&gt;enjoy</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fruits of that productivity. My being forced to pay for not only </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;irresponsible reproduction, but to pay an incompetent government </i><br>
<i>&gt;bureaucracy</i><br>
<i>&gt;to raise these children in such a negligent manner is also being </i><br>
<i>&gt;forced to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be an accessory to child neglect and abuse, while my own ability to </i><br>
<i>&gt;properly</i><br>
<i>&gt;support and demonstrate a fiscal ability to properly raise my own </i><br>
<i>&gt;offspring</i><br>
<i>&gt;is infringed upon. Pick someone elses pocket, buddy!!</i><br>
<p>
Um, and?  I agree with you, but what has this to do with<br>
whether humans are seen as products to be bought and<br>
sold?<br>
