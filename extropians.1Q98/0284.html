<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The government, if it exists, should only enforce laws to protect people's</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;criminalized, while theft by the government (taxation), certainly immoral, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;quite legal. Ideally, everything immoral should be illegal, and everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;should be legal. I am however, speaking of rational morality, not the often</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;idiotic kind advanced by religion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;For an example of immorality posing as morality, see the truly vile piece</i><br>
<i>&gt; by Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Sally Satel (an evil psychiatrist) in today's Wall Street Journal advocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;using coercion against drug users "for their own good." It's a shame this Nazi</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bitch is given space in one of our leading newspapers, but the WSJ is run by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;bunch of superstitious religious conservatives who have no idea of the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;meaning of freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mark conflates morality and law.  I believe the two are distinct.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; acts</i><br>
<i>&gt; which are immoral which should not be illegal, such as smoking.  Smoking is</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-destructive -- yet it should not be outlawed.  Under a rational morality,</i><br>
<i>&gt; smoking would be wrong, but no police officer would come knocking at your</i><br>
<i>&gt; door if you smoked.  Ditto for overeating, lack of exercise, most drug use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rational morality cannot be forced.  It must be spread by persuasion.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; only time force can be used is when someone initiates or threatens to</i><br>
<i>&gt; initiate force.  Then it is just a matter of defense or just retaliation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Correct. Law should only be applicable to cases where one individual<br>
hurts another in some way without consent. Every person should have the<br>
right to do whatever one wants with oneself, no matter how immoral, and<br>
only with others with their consent. THis is what I find so ironic about<br>
religious people trying to legislate morality. If a person has no legal<br>
choice but to be moral, where is the virtue??? Virtue comes from making<br>
the concious choice for being good, which can only occur if the<br>
individual is totally free to choose either way.<br>
