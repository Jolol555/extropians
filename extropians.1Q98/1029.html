Certainly, for purely rational thought is a fiction. Sterile fiction, at<br>
that. (contradictio in adjecto, even).<br>
<p>

Why, nothing. If it happens to suit the purposes, ok, go right ahead.<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; is for what rational reason does this *idea* repel you?</i><br>
<p>
If your firmware (I suggest an update) happens to poopoo the act, ok. Now,<br>
browse around:<br>

I mean, do you like it? C'mon. Can('t) you make you love/hate it? Is this<br>
about personal freedom and/or determinism, or what? And do you really<br>
really care?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I ask this not just because it's a difficult question, but because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Extropy has rationality at its core.  Now it's possible to think of</i><br>
<p>
Who says what? Who says (ratio, maybe?) I chose ratio for rational<br>
reasons? Who says ratio does at all exist? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; rational reasons for war, genocide, culling or anything else you care</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to mention, but when a reason against it is called for we tend to fall</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; back on morality, ethics, and right and wrong.  These IMHO are weak</i><br>
<p>
You don't happen to mean 'morality', 'ethics', and 'right' and 'wrong'? <br>
Then why don't you say just that? It's downright confusing, like. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; arguments against raw and unrelenting rationality, so what defenses do</i><br>
<p>
Raw and unrelenting, that's not the terms I'd use. I'd use 'sterile' and<br>
'mythical' in that context.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; we have against someone who's taken a very different slant on Extropy?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Surely they are just *pretending* to be all nice 'n' cosy &amp; fluffy...When the</i><br>

<p>
Who's pretending to be what? The hunting season for unicorns has not been<br>
opened yet, afair.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Seriously...Wax has a point. Why are Star Trek (or My Little Pony)</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethics so popular with this allegedly rational crowd? It does not</i><br>

You shu ain't got the full picture yet, boss. I suggest an ordered<br>
