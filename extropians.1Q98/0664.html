<i>&gt; |3rd Expert Claims Probe of Brown's Death Botched</i><br>
<i>&gt; |By Christopher Ruddy</i><br>
<i>&gt; |FOR THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW</i><br>
<i>&gt; |January 13, 1998</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Washington - The head of the Armed Forces Institute of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Pathology's forensic photography unit, like two other</i><br>
<i>&gt; |senior officials before her, has come forward to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |publicly claim that the military improperly handled the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |investigation of the death of Commerce Secretary Ron</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Brown.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Chief Petty Officer Kathleen Janoski, a 22 year Navy</i><br>
<i>&gt; |veteran, also says she was told missing evidence of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |possible homicide had been purposely destroyed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski, the senior enlisted person at AFIP's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Rockville, Md., offices, was present when Brown's body</i><br>
<i>&gt; |was examined by military pathologists at Dover Air</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Force Base in Delaware.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |The examination of Brown's remains took place four days</i><br>
<i>&gt; |after an Air Force CT-43 jet carrying him and 34 others</i><br>
<i>&gt; |crashed into a mountainside near Croatia's Dubrovnik</i><br>
<i>&gt; |airport on April 3, 1996.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski had initially declined to be interviewed but</i><br>
<i>&gt; |changed her mind shortly before a gag order was issued</i><br>
<i>&gt; |to AFIP staff. She came forward, she said, because AFIP</i><br>
<i>&gt; |had failed to properly investigate possible wrongdoing</i><br>
<i>&gt; |by its own officials in the Brown case, and because of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |the way the military treated two AFIP pathologists, Air</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Force Lt. Col. Steve Cogswell and Army Lt. Col. David</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Hause. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |In Tribune-Review articles last month, Cogswell and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Hause both went public about a small circular hole</i><br>
<i>&gt; |found in the very top of Brown's head. Both</i><br>
<i>&gt; |pathologists contend it looked like a gunshot wound and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |should have prompted an autopsy. No autopsy was</i><br>
<i>&gt; |performed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski said she was disturbed by criticism of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |lieutenant colonels and suggestions that their actions</i><br>
<i>&gt; |may be politically motivated. She described both</i><br>
<i>&gt; |pathologists as "serious professionals" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"competent." </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Partisan politics has nothing to do with the issues at</i><br>
<i>&gt; |hand, she suggested, noting that she has been a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |lifelong and active Democrat, beginning with volunteer</i><br>
<i>&gt; |work for the 1972 presidential campaign of George</i><br>
<i>&gt; |McGovern. She says she voted for Bill Clinton and is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |proud to receive a White House Christmas Card each year</i><br>
<i>&gt; |for having worked as a volunteer at the Clinton White</i><br>
<i>&gt; |House.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |INTERNAL PROBE </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |After Cogswell's allegations first surfaced in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Tribune-Review, AFIP launched an internal investigation</i><br>
<i>&gt; |of Cogswell and others to find out why and how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |information about Brown's head wound got to the press. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski said she was stunned that AFIP inquiry focused</i><br>
<i>&gt; |on the actions of Cogswell when she felt the real issue</i><br>
<i>&gt; |was AFIP's handling of Brown's death. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"The investigation is nothing more than a witch hunt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |(AFIP) should be investigating what happened to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |missing head X-rays. No one at AFIP seems to care that</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Brown did not receive an autopsy," Janoski said.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |On Easter Sunday, 1996, the task of examining Brown's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |body fell to Col. William Gormley, the highest ranking</i><br>
<i>&gt; |AFIP officer at Dover that day. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |While Gormley conducted an external examination of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Brown's body, Janoski was busy photographing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |documenting his injuries. Brown was still partially</i><br>
<i>&gt; |clad in a his torn trousers. His body was intact, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |chemical burns to his torso and face and several</i><br>
<i>&gt; |noticeable lacerations on the front, sides and top of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |his head. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |As she continued to shoot photos, she noticed a large</i><br>
<i>&gt; |area of torn skin that left the top of Brown's skull</i><br>
<i>&gt; |exposed. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |She was startled to find another injury. Dead center in</i><br>
<i>&gt; |the top of the head she observed what appeared to her</i><br>
<i>&gt; |to be a gunshot wound: a perfectly circular hole in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |skull. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"Wow, look at the hole in Ron Brown's head. It looks</i><br>
<i>&gt; |like a gunshot wound," Janoski recalls exclaiming.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski has served as chief of forensic photography for</i><br>
<i>&gt; |2 (1/2) years, and has, by her account, handled</i><br>
<i>&gt; |numerous cases involving either gunshots or plane</i><br>
<i>&gt; |crashes. She received training at the FBI Academy and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |elsewhere in observing, identifying and photographing</i><br>
<i>&gt; |gunshot and other wounds. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski's comments caused an immediate hubbub in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |morgue facility, and several pathologists came over to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |view the wound. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |One was Hause, a former Gulf War combat surgeon with </i><br>
<i>&gt; |significant plane accident and gunshot experience.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Hause examined the hole and said it looked like a .45</i><br>
<i>&gt; |caliber gunshot entry wound.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Gormley, who has approximately 25 years of experience</i><br>
<i>&gt; |in pathology, has said that he, too, identified the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |wound as a "red flag" and that he consulted with other</i><br>
<i>&gt; |pathologists present, including Hause and Navy Cmdr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Edward Kilbane.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"They agreed it look like an entrance gunshot wound,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Gormley recalled in a recent television interview. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |In two interviews with the Tribune-Review, Gormley</i><br>
<i>&gt; |maintained he ruled out the possibility of a gunshot</i><br>
<i>&gt; |because he observed, on closer inspection, that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |circular hole did not penetrate Brown's skull into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |brain. He said the brain was not visible, and had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |bullet struck Brown's head, it would have penetrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; |the skull. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Soon after the Tribune-Review published a photograph of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |the wound as well as photos of X-rays that showed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |skull had been penetrated, Gormley changed his story. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |During a television appearance, he admitted that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |photo and X-ray indeed showed the skull was penetrated</i><br>
<i>&gt; |and brown's brain was visible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Gormley noted it had been more than a year and a half</i><br>
<i>&gt; |since the Brown crash, and said he had simply forgotten</i><br>
<i>&gt; |what the wound looked like. In his initial report on</i><br>
<i>&gt; |the examination, Gormley noted the bullet had</i><br>
<i>&gt; |penetrated the skull. He maintained that the hole</i><br>
<i>&gt; |definitely wasn't a gunshot wound because X-rays showed</i><br>
<i>&gt; |no slug or metal fragments in the head, and there was</i><br>
<i>&gt; |no exit wound.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |In a recent press statement, AFIP said extensive</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"forensic tests" disproved a bullet theory. Janoski</i><br>
<i>&gt; |said she was present for the entire examination and she</i><br>
<i>&gt; |did not observe any forensic tests, such those for</i><br>
<i>&gt; |gunpowder residue around the wound. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |MISSING X-RAYS</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |In addition to pictures of the corpse itself, Janoski</i><br>
<i>&gt; |took photos of the original head and body X-rays while</i><br>
<i>&gt; |they were pinned to a lightbox.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |After her slide film was developed, Janoski said she</i><br>
<i>&gt; |stored the images, which are typically used by</i><br>
<i>&gt; |pathologists for lectures and are not part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |official case file, in her office desk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Almost six months later, Janoski said she was prompted</i><br>
<i>&gt; |to review the film after Brown's name surfaced during a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |discussion with Jean Marie Sentell, a naval criminal</i><br>
<i>&gt; |investigator assigned to the AFIP. Sentell had also</i><br>
<i>&gt; |been present when Brown's body was examined. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski alleges Sentell told her the original X-rays of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Brown's head had been replaced in the case file.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski said she remembers that Sentell specifically</i><br>
<i>&gt; |told her "the first head X-ray that showed a 'lead</i><br>
<i>&gt; |snowstorm' was destroyed, and a second X-ray, that was</i><br>
<i>&gt; |less dense, was taken."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski said she had to ask, "What are you talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; |about?" in reference to Sentell's phrase "lead</i><br>
<i>&gt; |snowstorm." According to Janoski, Sentell explained</i><br>
<i>&gt; |that a lead snowstorm is the description of a pattern</i><br>
<i>&gt; |of metal fragments that appears on an X-ray after a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |bullet has disintegrated inside a body. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski said Sentell did not say who destroyed the X-</i><br>
<i>&gt; |rays. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Sentell did not respond to repeated Tribune-Review</i><br>
<i>&gt; |phone messages seeking comment, even after being</i><br>
<i>&gt; |informed of Janoski's statements. An AFIP spokesman</i><br>
<i>&gt; |said Sentell declined to be interviewed. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |After the conversation with Sentell, Janoski said she</i><br>
<i>&gt; |rummaged through her own desk and found the slide film</i><br>
<i>&gt; |she had taken of the original head X-rays. She gave the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |film to Cogswell to review. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Cogswell contends the original frontal X-ray of Brown's</i><br>
<i>&gt; |head indeed showed an apparent "lead snowstorm" of</i><br>
<i>&gt; |metal fragments in brown's head. Cogswell has stated</i><br>
<i>&gt; |that the suspicious hole and the X-ray should have</i><br>
<i>&gt; |prompted AFIP to notify the FBI that Brown's death was</i><br>
<i>&gt; |a possible homicide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Cogswell, too, has alleged that he heard that the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; |X-rays were destroyed. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Still curious about the matter, Janoski pulled out</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Brown's official case file and discovered that the file</i><br>
<i>&gt; |contained only 15 X-rays of Brown, none of which were</i><br>
<i>&gt; |of the skull. She found neither of the original X-rays</i><br>
<i>&gt; |that she had photographed on the lightbox. </i><br>
<i>&gt; | </i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski said she became terrified when she realized</i><br>
<i>&gt; |that "I  possessed the only physical evidence that</i><br>
<i>&gt; |those X-rays ever existed."  </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |AFIP director Col. Michael Dickerson has acknowledged</i><br>
<i>&gt; |that all  skull X-rays of Brown are missing from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |case file. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Gormley has stated that the initial head X-rays did</i><br>
<i>&gt; |show possible fragments that concerned him at the time,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |but that Brown's head was X-rayed again and he</i><br>
<i>&gt; |discovered the pattern of fragments on the initial </i><br>
<i>&gt; |X-ray was actually caused by a defect in the </i><br>
<i>&gt; |reusable film cartridge. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |     </i><br>
<i>&gt; |The new images did not show any fragments in the head,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |but they, like the originals photographed by Janoski,</i><br>
<i>&gt; |have disappeared.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |One of the pathologists involved questions the timing</i><br>
<i>&gt; |of AFIP's explanation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"I find it interesting that this explanation about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; |film cartridge defect came after Lt. Col Cogswell made</i><br>
<i>&gt; |his allegations, and not at the time we were at Dover,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; |said Hause. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Hause, who made these comments to the Tribune-Review</i><br>
<i>&gt; |before a gag order had been placed on AFIP staff, said</i><br>
<i>&gt; |he does not recall ever being told there was problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; |with the X-rays. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski noted that the photos she took of other Brown</i><br>
<i>&gt; |X-rays on the light box did not show any such pattern.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Gormley and AFIP have not offered any explanation for</i><br>
<i>&gt; |how the  X-rays disappeared. Gormley referred calls to</i><br>
<i>&gt; |AFIP spokesman Chris Kelly,  who said that Gormley</i><br>
<i>&gt; |would not grant an additional interview.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |In recent days, Janoski was contacted and asked if she</i><br>
<i>&gt; |stood by her earlier comments. She said she did and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |added that AFIP officials are determined to "turn Lt.</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Col. Cogswell into scapegoat."</i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |She said AFIP investigators recently presented her with</i><br>
<i>&gt; |a list questions that focused on how the photographic</i><br>
<i>&gt; |images had found their way to the press. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |"I was never advised of my rights, and the tone and</i><br>
<i>&gt; |manner... was threatening and coercive," she said. </i><br>
<i>&gt; |</i><br>
<i>&gt; |Janoski reiterated to the Tribune-Review that she had</i><br>
<i>&gt; |done nothing improper, and that AFIP should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; |concentrating on why Ron Brown "did not receive a</i><br>
<i>&gt; |proper death investigation."</i><br>
