Don't look at me -- I voted against both sets of bastards. (Nice little<br>
anagram: TONY BLAIR MP == I'M TORY PLAN B. There's more than a germ of<br>
truth in it.)<br>

<p>
Not exactly true. The Labour party in the UK has basically succumbed to<br>
the same historic compromise that the Democrat party in the USA made<br>
a couple of decades ago, realigning themselves on the right.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What I want to know is WHY</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;governments at the end of the twentieth century have become bloated, </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;inefficient, and counterproductive monsters that are resented by many </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of their citizens. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My personal opinion is that with the rise of industrialisation and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentration of power in large industrial corporations, big government</i><br>
<i>&gt; became a good way for them to maintain power.</i><br>
<p>
Big corporations as the engine of government?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As people have got fed up with socialism and new technologies spread</i><br>
<i>&gt; power around, government is increasingly getting in the way and </i><br>
<i>&gt; proving unable to do anything worthwhile.</i><br>
<p>
That doesn't seem to explain the widespread _support_ for government<br>
institutions I see around me, at least here in the UK.<br>
<p>
My pet hypothesis is future shock; the whole of western civilization is<br>
suffering from a subliminal but chronic case of the ailment, with most <br>
people unable to examine any new development without slight feelings of<br>
panic and anxiety. This makes it really easy for moral panics and knee-<br>
jerk rejection to take over. (It's an easy target for politicians, too;<br>
in an increasingly globalized market, they _need_ some way of demonstrating<br>
to their constituents that they care deeply and can do something about<br>
their concerns. They can't jigger the interest rate or raise money through<br>
taxation very easily, but they can strike postures over trivial irrelevencies<br>
and promise legislation to control the perceived threat -- things like the<br>
current idiotic ban on human cloning, or the mass hysteria over satanic<br>
ritual child abuse a few years ago, or porn on the internet.)<br>
<p>
Select a random push-button issue and watch your neighbour jump to<br>
attention when you mention it; odds are, they haven't ever really<br>
_thought_ about it, because they're running as hard as they can just<br>
trying to get their heads around the necessary complexities of day to<br>
day life.  The standard stock response to an unfamiliar challenge is<br>
"the government ought to pass a law about it".  It's a lot easier to<br>
shrug it off onto Big Brother's shoulders than to have to think about<br>
uncomfortable and unfamiliar and possibly threatening new things --<br>
especially with so many other demands on their attention to worry about.<br>
