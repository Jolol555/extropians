In a message dated 98-02-16 20:49:38 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 It doesn't need diversity, it just needs those particular organisms.<br>
 Any organism that needed biodiversity in the desert wold be in a <br>
 bad way - deserts have relatively low biodiversity.<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
But not microbiologically low in biodiversity.  Anyway. . . Now _you_ also are<br>
placing limits on the range of biodivertity and I think that is exactly what<br>
your argument opponents are also saying--so you both agree.<br>
<p>
Curt, you seem to be arguing a moot point--increasing biodiversity from simple<br>
to complex lifeforms has already _caused_ the abundance of life on Earth by<br>
adding more and more life in hostile environmental niches. <br>
<p>
And evolution is self-perpetuating the biodiversity, whether the _rate_ of<br>
biodiversity is increasing or not.  <br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;The scare tactic "save the wild environment or we're all gonna die!"<br>
is bogus and, as such, will fail in the end. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
It _is_ IMNSHO a scare tactic.  There is no evidence that humans will have<br>
desire to, are now, or ever will _be_able_ to decrease or increase (i.e.,<br>
control) biodiversity to any statistically significant extent.  When you pull<br>
on it here, it stretches there.  And I am _not_ talking just about life on<br>
Earth!<br>
<p>
 (In a way, our own human bodies are biodiverse, each cell type doing it's own<br>
function.) <br>
<p>
There are however some 80,000+ parasitic/symbiotic triad interactions that<br>
seem to need (if not "biodiversity") at least each other to complete their<br>
life cycles.  The ones I work with are plant-mold-insect triads.  The plant<br>
needs the mold to process nutrients and the insect carries the mold to the<br>
soil where the seeds then germinate.    Many of the triads are used to<br>
colonize adverse environmental areas.  It is a big mistake to do what<br>
classical microbiologists do--"isolate" microogranisms from there biological<br>
help-mates many can't not survive at all then.  <br>
<p>
For instance it is (so far) impossible to repair many kinds injured cells<br>
without the correct pre-formed peptides from other species.  It is possible to<br>
synthesize the peptides if we knew which ones there were, but right now we<br>
don't.  It is biodiversity that helps this microbiological research, by<br>
showing us how problems were already solved by nature.  Biodiversity will help<br>
humans live in a greater array environments because of this--already has, e,g,<br>
cold weather survival technology,  deep sea survival are both based on animal<br>
and plant survival strategies.<br>
<p>
_Listeria_monocytrogenes_ in a nutrient starved environment, can not repair<br>
damage nor grow without specific deuteromycete (a group of mold species) by-<br>
products.  <br>
<p>
If fleas would die--birds would go blind because the fleas clear fecal matter<br>
from baby bird's eyes.<br>
<p>
If the Eucalyptus trees die--the Koala dies because that is all their enzyme<br>
systems can digest.--an old kid's school example.<br>
<p>
If you kill off all bacteria in humans--the humans die because _Candida<br>
albicans_ colonizes the humans and kills the humans.  This is called<br>
"competative inhibition."<br>
<p>
If you kill off the nitrogen cycle microorganisms--the plants die and that<br>
kills off the rest of the food chain, including humans.  Same for the oxygen<br>
cycle and the carbon cycle.<br>
<p>
If you have only one species left--say humans--and a virus like AIDS invades .<br>
. .  the only salvation is in that specie's own genetic "biodiversity."   In<br>
our case that is not much protection since probably 99.9999999% (9 logs = in<br>
the billions) of the human population is susceptable.  I wish humans<br>
themselves had more genetic "biodiversity."<br>
