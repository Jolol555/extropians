Phobocrat or Terrocrat?<br>

<i>&gt;Phobocrat is somewhat clearer as the meaning of</i><br>

<i>&gt;many english speakers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
This could turn out to be a great suggestion!<br>
"Phobocrat" has the advantage that we don't have<br>
to explain it.  It has a pleasant ring to it too!<br>
Please send me your feedback.  Do you think<br>
"phobocrat" has the potential to catch on and<br>
become a powerful meme?  <br>
<p>
In any case, I suggest we add "phobocrat" to the<br>
Freespeak lexicon and start using it.  We can use<br>
both "terrocrat" and "phobocrat" and see which<br>
becomes the more powerful meme.<br>

Consider a world in which people routinely use<br>
sticks to hurt others.  Those with the biggest<br>
sticks always win; those with the small sticks<br>
always lose.  How would you like to have a big<br>
stick?<br>

Now consider a world in which people routinely<br>
use words as weapons to hurt others.  Certain<br>
bullies have powerful words that put their victims<br>
in a weak position and make it easy for the bullies<br>
to run all over the victims.<br>

Have you ever heard of a phobocrat "judge"<br>
pronouncing a "sentence" on a victim, and the<br>
victim getting hurt as a result?<br>

<i>&gt;in this way because we are *only* full sovereign in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;world of freedom and sovereign individuals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Some freedom lovers say that "freedom is indivisible,"<br>
meaning that for any one of us to be free, everyone has<br>
to be free.  The logical extreme is that if there's just<br>
one unfree person on earth, then everyone else is also<br>
unfree.  Suppose everyone were free.  If I then locked<br>
up just one person, suddently everyone else on earth<br>
would be unfree.<br>
<p>
But, what if I'm really free and sovereign *by nature,*<br>
irrespective of the freedom and sovereignty of others?<br>
<p>
What if I can discover that I'm free and sovereign by<br>
nature -- and then, develop my knowledge, wits, and<br>
resources to the point that, for most practical purposes,<br>
I can live as a free sovereign -- irrespective of the<br>
"unfree" masses around me (who haven't yet discovered<br>
they're free and sovereign)?<br>
<p>
A consequence of being subjected to the "freedom is<br>
indivisible" peme can be that I waste much of my life<br>
and resources trying to "change the system" -- see<br>
Harry Browne's 'How I Found Freedom,' available from<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.bookzone.com/bookzone/10001105.html">http://www.bookzone.com/bookzone/10001105.html</a>&gt;.<br>
See also &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/ffp05.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/ffp05.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, individuals are different and<br>
unique and live in different circumstances.  For some,<br>
the most appropriate things to do are "educating others,"<br>
"changing the system," etc.  Division of labor.  For<br>
many of these people, it may be appropriate to operate<br>
according to the "freedom is indivisible" peme.  As<br>
free as am, I certainly would enjoy even more freedom<br>
at less risk, were it not for "the political system."<br>
<p>
But for those of us for whom it's more appropriate to<br>
free ourselves, would the "freedom is indivisible" peme<br>
be an example of using our own words to hurt ourselves?<br>
<p>
Could it be that if enough of us were to sufficiently<br>
free ourselves so we become, for practical purposes,<br>
"uncoerceable" by the phobocrats, their bogus<br>
"politcal systems" would be widely seen for what<br>
they are and will collapse?<br>

The "Construction of Systematic Thought"<br>

<i>&gt;The  political power of the former Soviet Union is</i><br>

their places?<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
According to Robert Pirsig in 'Zen and the Art of<br>
Motorcycle Maintenance': "But to tear down a factory<br>
or to revolt against a government or to avoid repairs<br>
of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack<br>
effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack<br>
is upon effects only, no change is possible.  The true<br>
system, the real system, is our present *construction<br>
of systematic thought* itself, *rationality* itself.<br>
And if a factory is torn down but the rationality which<br>
produced it is left standing, then that rationality will<br>
simply produce another factory.  If a revolution destroys<br>
a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of<br>
thought that produced that government are left intact,<br>
then those patterns will repeat themselves in the<br>
succeeding government..."  [emphasis added]<br>
<p>
What if the basic "construction of systematic thought,"<br>
the basic "rationality," consists of deep pemes?  If<br>
so, then in order to induce people to change the most<br>
fundamental beliefs that really count, might it not be<br>
necessary that we persuade them to dump some of their<br>
deep pemes?<br>
<p>
It's unlikely that any significant number of people<br>
in the former "Soviet Union" (so-called) dumped any<br>
of their deep pemes.  So, with minor differences,<br>
they just recreated their "political systems" as<br>
suggested by Robert Pirsig.<br>

What do you think of the "Phobocrat Series?"  We probably<br>
