I find this very interesting - I understood perfectly what both Anders<br>
and Kennita were saying, as I'm sure many others did - but why is this<br>
so difficult to explain?  As Kennita puts it, we seem to have an<br>
"intuitive grasp" of the idea.  If this is so, what was it that first<br>
gave us this?  The same can be said of many other subjects which may be<br>
considered extropian such as quantum theory (e.g. wave particle<br>
duality).  What is it about such subjects that causes them to require<br>
understanding on an intuitive level?  Is it their complexity, or just<br>
their bizarreness?<br>
<p>
I'm sure physics teachers (and people trying to explain other extropian<br>
ideas) would love to know! @:-)<br>
