If you don't like it, find another word.  This one is taken.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   IAN: In short, a "relation of sameness" is a fallacy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   for only different things can be related. </i><br>
<p>
Says who?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   "Same as"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is "non-identity."</i><br>
<p>
A less indulgent man might say this is crackpot talk.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   We can relate two things that are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   similar only to the extent that they are different,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   for example that they occupy two different spaces.</i><br>
<p>
Or different times.  If a cat walks into my room tonight, I will assume<br>
it's the same cat I saw this morning (unless its coloring is visibly<br>
different).  I mentally relate (compare) two perceptions and judge them<br>
to be of the same entity; this is vernacular identity.  I can never be<br>
certain that the cat hasn't been replaced with a similar cat while I<br>
wasn't looking, but as an operationalist I generally rely on the<br>
assumption that if I can't perceive a difference I can safely assume<br>
it's the same cat.<br>
<p>
I suppose you would say: "You make your judgement of the cat by<br>
measuring her difference from your shoes, the neighbor's dog, and other<br>
things that are not Fluffy."  That's partly true and partly false.  I<br>
know by experience that most of the things in the world do not look like<br>
Fluffy; but I do *not* examine anything else.  If I were in a black void<br>
and the only thing illuminated were a cat, I would say, without looking<br>
about for another comparand, "That's Fluffy" (or not, as the case may<br>
be).<br>
<p>
And then there's binocular vision: two perceptions of the same thing at<br>
the same place and time, yet slightly different.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   The perfect "same as relation" would be a relation of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   thing to itself, but such a relation is a null relation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Therefore the prevailing atomist definition of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;   is false, irrational, an clearly contrary to reality.</i><br>
<p>
And yet everyone but you finds a use for it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   Identity is difference, and difference is holistic.</i><br>

War is peace.<br>
