There are a few funny things here.  First, John and others are suggesting<br>
breaking an alleged monopoly (Gates' businesses) with a real monopoly<br>
(government).  In other words, to keep some people from getting too<br>
much power, they want to give other people even more power.  That<br>
strikes me as odd.<br>
<p>
Second, what about the Gateses of the past?  Microsoft is not the<br>
first startup to sweep through an industry and leave the old elite<br>
and others panting.  Ford nealy had a monopoly on cars.  Have<br>
you driven a Ford lately?  Most people don't today.  Was it the<br>
government that worked some magic to make other car companies<br>
compete?  No.  In fact, tariffs and import quotas help to keep Ford's<br>
competitors out, but yet it moves.  Honda, Toyota, Chrysler, etc.<br>
all make cars and compete with Ford.<br>
<p>
Third, the personal computer software market is relatively new.  As it<br>
matures, not only do I think more competitors will break into it, but<br>
consumers will demand more of an OS.  Maybe this will be more<br>
than Gates and Microsoft can deliver.  If so, competitors will eat<br>
his company alive.  If not, then perhaps it is because he is giving<br>
the people what they want.<br>
