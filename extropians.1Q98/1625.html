And objectively observe that observation of that particular phenomenon going  <br>

observation of the observation of that particular phenomenon going on in your <br>
brain really is objective, and objectively observe that ...<br>
<p>
We'll never get anywhere with that approach, we need to use a different <br>
tactic and we have one, behavior. <br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What the fundamental physical representation is like is very        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;important to consciousness and our ability to process information         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and consciously "know" about things.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
As you say this can have practical considerations, but I can find absolutely <br>
no evidence that the way information is represented has any philosophical <br>
ramifications at all.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;When there is a dot of red qualia in a field of green in our        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;conscious representation of a strawberry patch, the fundamental         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nature of this red qualia, what it is like, how it is fundamentally         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;different than a green qualia, how it stands out, and how it is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;represented in an isomorphically similar 3D space in our mind is a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;key part of the computation process that allows us to be aware of   </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and select the ripe strawberry that is ready to be picked.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, good qualia makes our behavior smarter and unlike consciousness,  <br>
intelligence can be tested for. They've improved a lot in the last few years  <br>
but even now no machine can do a job like picking ripe strawberry's as well  <br>
as a human, so I think it's safe to say that a machine's qualia of red is not  <br>
as rich as a human's. Yet.<br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;To exist information must be in a context, otherwise a hole in a        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;paper tape is not data it's just a hole, but there is nothing unique        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;about the human mind in that regard.</i><br>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;No.  This is only when talking about abstract information.</i><br>
            <br>
I don't understand your objection, all information is abstract.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It is when you try to represent that oxygen atom with wholes in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;paper tape that requires the mapping, context, and interpretation.  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
And a human brain can put a hole in a tape in the context of other holes and <br>
so obtain information from that tape, but obviously machines can do this too, <br>
that's why punched tape was invented and that's why feeding such a tape into <br>
a machine does not produce random output.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Red is like red, there is no other meaning required.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, some things can not be reduced further, and I can give another <br>
example. Intelligence produces consciousness, no explanation why is required  <br>
or possible.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Searls's Chinese Room         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Searls's Chinese Room is a foolish thought experiment that teaches us nothing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;proves is that any physical phenomenon, no matter how absurdly         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;inefficient, can abstractly represent or model any other physical         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;phenomenon, including conscious qualia, and can eventually duplicate        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the output. This has nothing to do with the fundamental nature of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;qualia </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Nothing to do with it?! I think it has everything to do with it, good thing  <br>
too because that's all you'll ever know for sure about the subjective <br>
experience of another person or machine. If I'm wrong about consciousness <br>
then random mutation and natural selection would never have bothered to come <br>
up with it, but I know for sure that it managed to produce it at least one <br>
time because I'm conscious, I have a strong hunch you are too.<br>
<p>
I'll never be able to prove it, but I think the best way to make progress in  <br>
this area is to just forget about consciousness and concentrate on <br>
intelligence, because you'll get consciousness anyway and free of charge.  <br>
That's the tactic Evolution took, in fact nature found that intelligence was <br>
a much harder nut to crack than consciousness. The emotional parts of our <br>
brains are very old, little different from that found in many other animals, <br>
the higher brain functions, like logic and simulating the future so we can <br>
make plans, operate in much more recently evolved parts of the brain. <br>
Conscienceless is a dime a dozen, intelligence is not, If nature  found one <br>
to be much harder to produce than the other, why would the opposite to be <br>
true when we design our machines?<br>
