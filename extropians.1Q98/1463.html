The term [`hard cases'] originally meant cases that tug at the heartstrings;<br>
that is its meaning in the old saw `hard cases make bad law.'  By semantic<br>
drift it has come to mean difficult cases, which makes nonsense of the old saw.<br>
Only difficult cases make law, good or bad.  Cases that are easy to decide are<br>
so by virtue of being controlled by existing law.<br>

<p>
There is an old and somewhat foolish saying that `Hard cases make bad law,'<br>
and therefore the law must be left as it is.  It would be equally true to say,<br>
`Bad law makes hard cases,' and therefore the law must be amended.  The real<br>
truth lies somewhere between.  Mere freaks of fortune should not be made an<br>
excuse for weakening a law which is sound.  But a law which is seen to multiply<br>
hard cases, not through any accident but by its necessary elements, is not<br>
worth preserving, for the law was made for man, not man for the law.<br>
	-- A. P. Herbert, through the fictional Justice Wool in Pale v. Pale<br>
