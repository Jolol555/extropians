Well, the memes might benefit from longer-lived humans, but being<br>
able to transmit memes does not in and of itself change the biology.<br>
While memes add to the benefit of long life, most species gene sets<br>
have already evolved to let the individuals live as long as<br>
as possible.<br>
<p>
It's true that humans have been through a major lifespan change <br>
recently that extended lifespan by 50%-100% (the old 100% oft cited<br>
seems to exaggerate a bit; chimps live longer than we had thought).<br>
The genes might not yet have reached an optimum.  There's an <br>
interesting Danish twin longevity study which tackled whether<br>
genetic variation in human lifespans can evolve (generally species<br>
have a fair amount of genetic variability in lifespan but it's<br>
not evolvable).  Frustratingly, they considered only the options<br>
of "it's all evolvable" and "none is evolvable".  "None" won<br>
out by a statistical hair.  Realistically, probably some of the<br>
variation can evolve and some can't; if we assume that the similar<br>
predictive power of the two approaches means we should split the<br>
difference (completely uncalled for but oh well...) then 10%<br>
of variation in human lifespan comes from evolvable genetic variation.<br>
This is very high - fruit flies are at 3% - and would make broad-spectrum<br>
approaches like whole-body telomerase stimulation somewhat plausible.<br>
