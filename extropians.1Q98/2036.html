<i>&gt; Some VLCC's are larger than 500,000 dwt, but the economics are even worse</i><br>
<i>&gt; than what you say. For their size supertankers are the cheapest ships on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sea, partly because they're poorly made and designed to last only a few years,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but mostly because they're nothing but floating oil tanks. To convert such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hulk into a ship capable of carrying lots of people could easily cost 10</i><br>
<i>&gt; times as much.  If you were low on machine guns and thus expected people to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the ship their home voluntarily then you'd have to make it somewhat more</i><br>
<i>&gt; comfortable than a slave ship, and that would cost at least 100 times as much</i><br>
<i>&gt; and probably much more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Even if these economic problems could be overcome we'd still only exist at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the whim of the superpowers, if we were not good little boys they'd send a</i><br>
<i>&gt; torpedo up our ass and sink the ship so fast it'd bounce off the bottom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think countries suck and there are too many of them already, and I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; David Musick got it exactly right when he said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Aren't we *beyond* thinking of countries in terms of land area? Is't it</i><br>
<i>&gt;   more realistic to think of countries in terms of organization,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   communication and resource movement? [...] I see the idea of a "country"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   as a relic from a dying age, as global economics blurrs and erases national</i><br>
<i>&gt;   borders."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
As national borders of those nations that willingly give up sovereignty to some<br>
nebulous international order, all this does for the average person is make it that<br>
much harder to tell who is trying to screw you. Call it political luddism, or what<br>
you will, but it would be nice for a change to have one bureaucracy that was<br>
responsible to you, and couldn't pass the buck up or down or round and round until<br>
you just gave up and bent over.<br>
<p>
Recen'ty here in Lebanon, a gentleman who was having difficulty registering his<br>
car with the local busybodies simply said in frustration,"I'm suprised that that<br>
shooter didn't start his spree here. I would." (this was a month after the Carl<br>
Drega shooting spree in which a property tax protester finally went postal on the<br>
corrupt judge who assessed his property at 3 times its actual market value, such<br>
that his property taxes would be so high that he would have to move out of the<br>
community.)  In no time at all this average citizen was tracked down and arrested<br>
for assault. Now the local gov't busycrats want guns to be banned in all public<br>
spaces. I say turn it around. Make it legal for any citizen to give a bureaucrat<br>
who is giving them a hard time a good smack up side the head. At the very least<br>
allow the average citizen to issue citations to bureaucrats for stupidity,<br>
obfuscation, and inefficiency.<br>
<p>
I dunno, John, maybe you enjoy spending an entire day of your working life in the<br>
DMV, trying to get the legal fabrications of a few states off your record just so<br>
you can drive to work. I don't. Fact is that the current system needs a good<br>
razing. As this doesn't seem likely, starting from scratch somewhere else is a<br>
more cost effective solution.<br>
