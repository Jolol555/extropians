The current "standard" expansion theory holds that the universe expands,<br>
but<br>
that local effects (mostly gravity) keep certain small bodies (up to<br>
about the<br>
size of galactic clusters) together. Galaxies therefore don't expand,<br>
and<br>
neither do gold watches. because the expansion isn't strong enough<br>
to overcome chemical bonds, or even gravity when matter is dense enough.<br>
<p>
In fact, the "open or closed?" question is actually a question of<br>
whether<br>
the universe's average density is great enough to eventually<br>
gravitationally<br>
overcome the expansion.<br>
