AFAIK PCR (pancritical rationalism) was based largely on Popper's<br>
original work on critical rationalism. I don't think anybody has since<br>
invented a better way of discerning potential knowledge from falsehood,<br>
while keeping an open mind to new ideas and always reducing error. PCR<br>
is the scaffolding upon which Extropian epistemology is based. I<br>
woulnd't call that idiocy.<br>
<p>
Popper's reasoning is a lot more coherent than John Horgan makes it out<br>
to be in the shallow treatment presented in that interview. Horgan<br>
doesn't stop after bashing Popper--through the rest of that book, a<br>
number of other big-name scientists are shown to be bumbling idiots as<br>
well. Horgan is a pretty sharp writer with a broad knowledge base, but<br>
IMHO he gets way too uppity with a number of well-respected,<br>
leading-edge thinkers. Most of the time he is *so* sure of himself, that<br>
*his* theory (the rise of "ironic science") is right and nothin' nobody<br>
says is gonna change his mind, no matter what.<br>
<p>
His abusive tone and derisive remarks about some of the other<br>
interviewees are downright childish at times. Of course, he doesn't say<br>
anything rude to their faces, he saves it all for the narratives he<br>
writes later to pad out the interviews. I lost a lot of respect for<br>
Horgan while reading _The End of Science_...  Making fun of the guys you<br>
don't agree with is not a valid way to go about making your point.<br>
<p>
John Horgan is an anti-Extropian. He'd call us all hopeless dreamers<br>
living in a fantasy world eagerly awaiting a technological utopia that's<br>
never going to arrive. Instead, apparently, science is just going to<br>
"run out of steam" and innovation will somehow just gradually slow down<br>
and then stop.<br>
<p>
Uh-huh. Right. I guess neo-tech is the only thing that can save us<br>
now...<br>
