<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; When AI systems will be available, you will of course have the tools</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to read their whole minds directly, which would solve the problem above,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; but this method would violate their rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Not necessarily. If you start to examine my innards without</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; permission, it would be a violation of my rights. But I can give a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; doctor at least a temporary permission to examine my internal state,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and that does not violate my rights.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We might be able to do even better. Have a special-purpose machine</i><br>
<i>&gt; that scans your mind and gives as output a binary answer to whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are responsible or not. Then the memory of this machine is</i><br>
<i>&gt; automatically erased and only the output remains. The subject to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; investigated can be allowed to make any arrangements necessary to</i><br>
<i>&gt; verify the validity and confidentiality of the proceedure.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suppose such a machine existed for deciding with 100% accuracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; whether somebody had commited a certain crime. It would then be hard</i><br>
<i>&gt; to argue that the law enforcing agency did not have the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; apply this technique to any subject it wanted to (provided that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was quick and had no side effects). For to refuse the law enforcing</i><br>
<i>&gt; agency the unlimited right to use this technique would be equivalent</i><br>
<i>&gt; to refusing it to maximise its detection rate of criminals, even when</i><br>
<i>&gt; no externalities were involved. What legitimate reason could anybody</i><br>
<i>&gt; have for not wanting the law enforcing agency scan his mind with this</i><br>
<i>&gt; device in order to find out if he had commited a crime?</i><br>
<p>
Simple: The 5th Amendment. It is my right to not be forced to<br>
incriminate myself. Scanning my innards with some whizbang device is<br>
using technology to make me involuntarily incriminate myself. This is<br>
also why you can't be forced to take a lie detector test. If you think<br>
I've done something wrong, its up to you to prove I did it with evidence<br>
that is external to me. I am innocent until you PROVE me guilty. I can<br>
then, if I so choose, use your fancy device to counter your evidentiary<br>
proof by volunteering to have myself scanned.<br>
<p>
Now, in the case of an AI system wishing to prove its sentience and<br>
attain some measure of 'human' status, the courts currently are bigoted<br>
against anything that doesn't look like a human and can't prove a<br>
natural birth. Note that with bans on cloning starting to appear, if one<br>
is found to be a clone, one's humanity can be legally debated. I expect<br>
that over time, this bigotry will go the way of the old parts of the<br>
Constitution that stated that a black slave was only 3/5ths or so of a<br>
man, etc. I don't know if we will have our own Clone Wars to push this<br>
through.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Or do we perhaps *want* a certain failure rate of the law enforcing</i><br>
<i>&gt; system, so that if the political systems lead to really screwed up</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws, there will at least be some chance of escaping them and perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; starting a revolution. Is criminality a little bit like random noice,</i><br>
<i>&gt; so that a certain amount is beneficial since it makes the system less</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely to get stuck in a "local maximum"?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, perhaps it is good for the justice system to act as a filter,<br>
weeding out stupid criminals. Unfortunately, with today's complex legals<br>
system, it tends to devolve to who can hire the smartest lawyer.<br>
<p>
On a similar note, I just won a legal victory against the City of<br>
Seattle. They had been claiming for years that I was a resident of<br>
Washington State, simply because I had once got a speeding ticket there<br>
while stationed in the area in the Air Force. Everytime I was pulled<br>
over after that, the cops would say that I was a resident, so my NH<br>
drivers license was no good, and therefore my NH car insurance was no<br>
good. SO it was typically an automatic $700 worth of fines every time I<br>
was pulled over. SInce they would look stupid in court if they sent the<br>
summons to my legal address in NH, they refused to use my legal address,<br>
so I never got a summons. This caused multiple charges of Failure to<br>
Appear to pile up in the docket, culminating in a suspension of my<br>
license to drive in Washington, which screwed up my ability to renew my<br>
license here in NH, and a charge of driving without a license in the 3rd<br>
degree the last  time I was pulled over in Seattle. Well, I just got all<br>
of the charges dismissed, and I am preparing to sue the city for the 2<br>
years I've been without a license here in NH because their system was so<br>
screwed up.<br>
