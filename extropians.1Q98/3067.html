<i>&gt;- Basic: billge's beloved language</i><br>
<p>
If this was true, we should have a decent, *compiling* BASIC by now.<br>
BASIC is very important for computers, because it allows semi-programmers to<br>
write little programs for everyday work without having to dig into tons of<br>
manuals. I learned BASIC at the age of 8 without any handbook or<br>
introduction, just by looking at examples. That doesn't mean that I'm an<br>
especially bright guy, but that BASIC is suitable for anyone, even kids can<br>
learn it. Actually, we'd need a more simplified, natural-language-like and<br>
object-oriented compilable version of BASIC bundled with every PC. Visual<br>
Basic is absolute crap [TM] -- needs runtimes, is incredibly slow and you<br>
can't even write a Breakout Clone with it.<br>
<p>
There need to be two main program languages for any system: One for the very<br>
beginners, but still very powerful and performant. Just a reduced<br>
instruction set and a more human-oriented way of semantic representation.<br>
Another one for the bigger projects, but even this language should be easy<br>
to learn and to handle. I know of no language suitable for either purpose on<br>
today's operating systems. The BASICs we have are ridiculous -- I can do far<br>
more with DOS' Power Basic -- and C++ is hardly readable and hard to learn.<br>
Anyway, BASIC certainly does not deserve it to be treated with three words.<br>
It *is* useful, only Bill's version of it isn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;- Java: the ucsd-p of the 90's</i><br>
<p>
Besides the P-Machine I do not see many parallels here. Java is, AFAIK, more<br>
object-oriented, gives more possibilities to program UIs and has now decent<br>
database support, too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Ok, we've got Python and Perl -- but these are not mainstream software</i><br>
<i>&gt;developer's languages.</i><br>
<p>
Don't forget Tcl/TK for developing simple graphical UIs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Most people can't learn second languages very well. Besides, we _have_ a</i><br>
<i>&gt;lingua franca already. While I never understood why they dropped Latin for</i><br>
<i>&gt;frogspeak -- let's stick to English, it is a simple enough language.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's the most popular language, but that doesn't make it the ideal one. I<br>
don't know enough about Esperanto to like it, but as I dig into Japanese, I<br>
find that it offers many advantages to other languages, with the drawback of<br>
unnecessary politeness verbs. (It is, in many aspects, more simple than<br>
English, you don't have to worry about pronouns so much.) It would be nice<br>
to have a language which also represents a more liberal worldview towards<br>
things. For example, I actually see little purpose in diferring between man<br>
and woman. Some Newspeak, anyone?<br>
<p>
