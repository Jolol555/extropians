Your line of argument sounds reasonable and is frequently cited by<br>
believers<br>
of various types (UFO people, religious people, etc.) It has a big<br>
problem,<br>
however: There are an infinite number of non-refuted theories to explain<br>
any phenomenon. (Proof: if there is a valid theory to explain something,<br>
then<br>
you can add any non-refutable hypothesis to it to derive another<br>
non-refutable<br>
theory.) I don't have time to deal with an infinite number of<br>
non-refuted<br>
theories. It there are two theories, one with hypothesis set "A" and one<br>
with hypothesis set "A" + "B", where "B" is non-refutable, then I am<br>
free<br>
to ignore the second theory. "B" adds nothing to the theory, and the<br>
predictive power of the theory "A"+"B" is identical to the predictive<br>
power of "A". Therefore, the predictive power of the theory provides<br>
no support for "B".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a practical standpoint, this means that you will have to show me</i><br>
some evidence if you want me to evaluate a new theory. This habit of<br>
thought is often referred to as "Occam's razor."<br>
