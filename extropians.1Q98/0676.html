<i>&gt; Okay.  I have a few quibbles here and there, but the main question, the</i><br>

<i>&gt; as possible a respect for rights and liberty in their libertarian</i><br>

<i>&gt; so long as they didn't veer too much into Basics.  But the thing that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; most relevant to the topic at hand is that the organization you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; outlining would be pretty indistinguishable from a libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; organization and I can't see why it wouldn't represent an unecessary</i><br>
<i>&gt; duplication of services.  Is there a uniquely *extropian* agenda and space</i><br>
<i>&gt; of activism that remains to be filled, one that might actually deserve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moniker "the extropian *movement*"?  Best, Dale</i><br>

  I understand, and I can see what you mean. Its always good to start with a<br>
more narrow focus, I guess I just wanted to make sure that this concept was<br>
considered the backbone, that which is in need of little debate or waste of<br>
bandwidth. Based on this, we should engage in legal cases where clear issues<br>
of infringement of rights to use technology are infringed. I agree that while<br>
what I originally was proposing just sounded like Libertarian Party II, we<br>
need to put a more narrow focus on to emphasisze the technological aspects.<br>
<p>
I think that the present cloning thing we should really rally about, as its<br>
really becoming a flash point. Things are getting WAY out of hand.  If we had<br>
a program with "Harry &amp; Betty Smith" as the subjects, two ordinary people who<br>
can't have healthy kids unless they clone, produced and put on one of the tv<br>
news programs or some such, we could start to score points. Maybe get a couple<br>
of religious nuts to say some really embarrassing things to illustrate who the<br>
radicals really are.<br>
