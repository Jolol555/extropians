A high five to Natasha for her three salient points.<br>
<p>
&lt;pseudo-conspiracy-rant mode on&gt;<br>
<p>
READ MY BITS, "NSA-CIA-How's your police state run today"--and a big HELLO<br>
to aaaaall those lovely Inslaw shareware supporters out there in the 'net<br>
who may just be tuning in now...<br>
<p>
Buying off a witness is not what the good guys do. Absent principle,<br>
someone who purports to be a "leader" of a "free world" has only got the<br>
slop bucket and the slaughterhouse. I am fortunate to be able to say that<br>
neither move me as much as my principle moves me; I don't claim it makes me<br>
fundamentally superior to others with different priorities. But if such a<br>
person is found out while in office, the rules say they get removed from<br>
the game. Let's do _that_ the lawful way, shall we? <br>
<p>
&lt;mockery mode on&gt;<br>
<p>
Hey Hillary! If it takes a village, I nominate your husband's penis for<br>
village idiot. <br>
<p>
Let's see if we have a mandate for _that_. Hmm, what is the etymological<br>
root of the word "dork"?<br>
<p>
PO: Let's not impeach him, let's just pass a "white Kryptonite" federal law<br>
that removes all his powers until he steps down. Hmmm. Or he has to wear a<br>
dunce cap except in his sleeping quarters as long as he remains in office.<br>
Or a law that enforces a novelty condom cap portrait shot required during<br>
every photo op. Heck, how about anyone that lets the Secret Service pat<br>
them down gets to pie him or pants him?<br>
<p>
Let's find a new way, every day, to mock Slick Willie until he wilts!<br>
...IF he deserves it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1.      His Interfering with a witness is a felony. -- BIG mistake.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.      His lying is distasteful.  -- Unhealthy problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3.      The unabashed and blatantly crude tell-tale behavior of those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;had sex with him (more likely than not because of his power) in</i><br>
<i>&gt;disclosing/blabbing it to the press (more likely than not because of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;money) and then the ultimate insult of acting as if they are doing something</i><br>
<i>&gt;for some kind of justice or cause for "women" is an act of pretention. --</i><br>
<i>&gt;Dim-sightedness!</i><br>
<p>
a figleaf which hides nothing... if that is what they are doing. :)<br>
