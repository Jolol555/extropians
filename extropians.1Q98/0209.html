I have come across a site that some of you may have already seen, but<br>
from what I can see, is an excellent indication of the beginnings of a<br>
completely virtual economy.<br>
<p>
Check out <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/">http://www.experts-exchange.com/</a><br>
<p>
What it is, is an independent technical support site for all sorts of<br>
computer software/OS's/equipment/etc. that is operated by its members.<br>
The way it works is you register as a user. Initial registration gives<br>
you 300 'points' to spend on asking technical questions of people who<br>
are registered as 'experts'. There are no qualification requirements to<br>
be an expert, you just have to also register as an expert if you feel<br>
you can contribute, and users acknowledge that they cannot hold the<br>
exchange nor the 'experts' responsible for the advice given. Anyone who<br>
is an expert can offer suggested solutions, and if one works, the user<br>
can confirm the successful solution, evaluate the quality of the<br>
solution given, and award the points they originally bid, plus any<br>
quality points based on the grading by the user, to the account of the<br>
expert who was correct.<br>
<p>
Here is the financial thing I am getting at: Once you 'spend' all of<br>
your 300 initial points, you can buy more points for $0.10 a piece. This<br>
means that for experts, they can themselves earn points that they can<br>
use for free support from experts in other areas. While this is<br>
currently a closed system that obviously requires input from 'real<br>
money', this could eventually build up enough of a 'point supply' to act<br>
as a mini economy of its own, and this is a harbinger for being expanded<br>
to a whole slew of internet products and services that would  eventually<br>
independent of the real money system.<br>
<p>
I registered as both user and expert. I then went to the directory of<br>
questions on the NT operating system, hoping to find that someone else<br>
had asked, and hopefully gotten a solution to, that case sensitivity bug<br>
I had found in NT last week (as you can 'purchase' the solutions to<br>
previously asked questions for a discount from the original solution<br>
cost). I found a guy who was asking a quesiton about RAM vs. virtual<br>
memory allocation, which I knew the answer to, so I replied with the<br>
answer, as well as with another related tip for increasing performance.<br>
THe original bid by the user for the solution was 50 points, but he said<br>
my solution improved his performance so much that I got 200 points for<br>
such a quality answer. So now I've got 500 points to spend on support<br>
quesitons of my own. I earned $20 worth of support with just 5 minutes<br>
of typing. How bout that???<br>
