Hi!<br>

I'm sure that puting the telomerase gene active in adult mammals will<br>
soon follow -- if nothing unespected happens, like I propose in the<br>
bottom of this message. Anyway, about this great experiment, I don't<br>
want to be the skeptic of the group but I would like to remind a couple<br>
of things: (1) certain cells that do not divide -- post-mitotic cells<br>
like neurons -- might also age. The proof for this is that most of the<br>
cells of the fruit fly do not divide after adulthood and yet it shows<br>
signs of aging; (2) non-aging species also don't have telomerase and yet<br>
they appear not to age; (3) the behaviour of the cells "in vivo" can be<br>
completely different; (4) even that telomerase solves all our aging<br>
problems, how are we going to make our cells produce telomerase or at<br>
least make its genes active?<br>
<p>
Even so, it was a very exciting discovery that can lead us towards<br>
immortality.<br>

<p>
Here's a question for you, if our cells have the genes that code for<br>
telomerase, why isn't it active in all cells? Could it be that<br>
telomerase has other functions? Could it be that the genes of telomerase<br>
code other proteins that must be inibited after cellular<br>
differentiation? Could it be that telomerase is harmful in some tissues?<br>
