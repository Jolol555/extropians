<i>&gt; objectively observe that the observation of the observation of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular phenomenon going on in your brain really is objective,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and objectively observe that ...</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We'll never get anywhere with that approach, we need to use a</i><br>
<i>&gt; different tactic and we have one, behavior.</i><br>
<p>
	No.  Something physically real and objectively (or abstractly)<br>
observable is going on in our brain that is producing conscious<br>
sensations or qualia.  We simply must figure out how and why this is.<br>
Once we do this we will have, or be able to produce, a one to one<br>
mapping between particular objective physical phenomenon observed by<br>
scientific instruments in our brain and the real qualia sensations we<br>
introspectively feel.  With such we will be able to perfectly predict<br>
what a person is seeing and/or eventually produce sensations in the<br>
mind and know what the experiencer will sense.<br>
<p>
	Someone will say, I'm going to manipulate/stimulate a part of<br>
your brain in such a way that it will produce precisely the sensation<br>
I experience or use to represent salt in your mind.  The experiencer<br>
might respond with, that's not what salt tastes like to me. You would<br>
be able to verify that this person isn't lying, and that he uses a<br>
different sensation to represent salt because you will be able to<br>
objectively observe the physical phenomenon that is producing his<br>
sensation and see that it is different.  You could then reverse the<br>
process so you would both be able to understand both sensations both<br>
objectively and subjectively or introspectively.  You would then know<br>
what both salt sensations were like and how they were different just<br>
as you now know that salty is very different than, say, a warm or<br>
painful... sensation.<br>
<p>
	We will be able to eff the currently ineffable and this will<br>
finally get us around all such problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As you say this can have practical considerations, but I can find</i><br>
<i>&gt; absolutely no evidence that the way information is represented has</i><br>
<i>&gt; any philosophical ramifications at all.</i><br>
<p>
	Are you saying that abstractly representing 700 nm light with<br>
an array of transistors in a particular state could reproduce the same<br>
phenomenally glorious "red" qualia your consciousness use to represent<br>
700 nm light?  The proof is in the introspection.  You know what red<br>
is like and how it is different than other qualia.  You can't ignore<br>
the importance and realness of these representations and what they are<br>
like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't understand your objection, all information is abstract.</i><br>
<p>
	In order to represent any abstract information, there must be<br>
some physically real phenomenon that can reliably assume various<br>
different distinguishable states.  Light can exist in various<br>
distinguishable wavelengths.  Thereby it can abstractly represent<br>
information.  700 nm light can represent a red quale.  Our mind can<br>
produce various different color qualia.  In the same way it can<br>
thereby abstractly represent information.  Even though red can<br>
represent 700 nm light and visa versa, the two are not anything "like"<br>
each other.  The fundamental nature of any particular physical<br>
phenomenon and all it's attributes are what they are "like".  Though<br>
certain physical phenomenon can model different physical phenomenon,<br>
they will never be precisely, fundamentally, like each other.  The<br>
actual true fundamental base nature of whatever is doing the physical<br>
representation is important and can never be completely duplicated,<br>
other than abstractly, by some other physical phenomenon.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree, some things can not be reduced further, and I can give</i><br>
<i>&gt; another example. Intelligence produces consciousness, no explanation</i><br>
<i>&gt; why is required or possible.</i><br>
<p>
	You are as smart as I am.  But if you use a drastically<br>
different sensation to represent a salty taste than I do, this<br>
matters.  A purely abstract machine can achieve the same ability to be<br>
aware of salt.  But again, the fact that there is no real subjective<br>
salty that is representing salt still matters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'll never be able to prove it, but I think the best way to make</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress in this area is to just forget about consciousness and</i><br>
<i>&gt; concentrate on intelligence, because you'll get consciousness anyway</i><br>
<i>&gt; and free of charge.</i><br>
<p>
	I believe this is exactly why we have not yet made progress.<br>
People think that red is something out beyond our eyes, some quality<br>
of light or something.  Therefore, they don't realize how real it is,<br>
how important it is, and how our conscious/intelligent worlds are<br>
built out of this real subjective physical phenomenon.  Forget all the<br>
intelligence for the moment!  A stupid human with no other intelligent<br>
ability other than the ability to tell what color something is is what<br>
is really important.  If we could figure out what this stupid person<br>
is using to represent this red knowledge and what it is like for him<br>
to have this knowledge, why and how all this works, how this stupid<br>
person is different than an abstract color detecting machine..., we<br>
could then, finally, figure out all the rest of the intelligence.<br>
