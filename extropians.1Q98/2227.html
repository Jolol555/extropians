<p>
He is clearly one of the most important "founders of transhumanism" but, as<br>
others have already pointed out, there are many, many others before him who<br>
saw key elements of the transhumanist or extropian idea and there have been<br>
others since the publication of his seminal works that have added important<br>
value to the ideas and values we express and develop as extropians.  Just off<br>
the top of my head I can think of the U.S. Founders and the other giants at<br>
the dawn of the age of classical liberalism as vital progenitors of extropian<br>
political and legal thought.  Charles Darwin is surely as important a<br>
conceptual founder of extropian scientific thinking as many 20th century<br>
figures.  Closer to the core synthesis of uniquely transhuman thought, Mary<br>
Shelley saw very clearly a good deal of the ethical material that obviously<br>
concerns transhumanists and extropians. Olaf Stapleton likewise described<br>
almost all of the core ideas and problems of transhumanism before FM 2030.<br>
Closer to our own age, Stanislaw Lem and Arthur Clark have been writing about<br>
the concept of technologically-mediated transcendence of biological evolution<br>
at least as long as FM 2030.  The list of other contributors to the ideas of<br>
transhumanism and extropiansim is so long that I won't spend the very few<br>
moments of relatively lucid thought I enjoy during my second cup of coffee<br>
lengthening it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  What substance is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the act of coining a term for a concept that someone else</i><br>
<i>&gt;  created?</i><br>
<p>
The act of naming an idea is fundamental to the process of cognitive progress.<br>
While every idea has antecedents with other names, a truly new idea is in a<br>
sense "born" when it is named separately from its antecedents.  The cluster of<br>
ideas and values that is "Extropy" earns a unique name because of our insight<br>
into the connection between technologically-mediated transcendence on the one<br>
hand and certain "political" and ethical ideas on the other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Don't get me wrong, coining terms is great idea since it can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  help to improve commmunication.  Take a concept that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  otherwise take a sentence or two to trigger the reader's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mind and encapsulate it in a word.  But I see a lot of people</i><br>
<i>&gt;  patting themselves on the back for simply coining a term.</i><br>
<p>
There is surely some of this, but perhaps you mistake pride in authorship of<br>
the insight named by the term for pride in authorship of the term.  As<br>
extropians, we share the thought that the best course through the<br>
transhumanist period is navigated by a return to the ideals of classical<br>
liberalism, tempered by a knowledge of current evolutionary theory (rather<br>
than the necessarily primitive concepts of evolution current during the first<br>
age of liberalism).  We think this may well mark the development of a new<br>
cultural paradigm, just as the founders of the modern age did: Revisit the<br>
writings of late 18th and early 19th centuries and you will see the same tone<br>
of excitement at living during a revolutionary age, the same sense of urgency<br>
and pride.  The folks who gathered in Philadelphia 200 years ago or so patted<br>
themselves on the back, as well, while looking over their shoulders for<br>
threats from the defenders of the old ways of thought.  You'll find some of<br>
that latter mentality among us, as well.  "We must all hang together or surely<br>
we shall all hang separately," said one of the first transhumanists.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Extropian art?  I've just do not get it.  What is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  significance of art by people who actively strive for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  transhumanism.  I am not saying it has no significance.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;  how significant is it in the grand scheme of things? [snip]</i><br>
<p>
Excuse the strong reaction, but I find this comment so far off the mark that I<br>
can barely formulate a response.  Nevertheless, for fear of it being said that<br>
I was ever at a loss for words, let me offer the following response:<br>
<p>
As others have already pointed out, the artistic urge may well be central to<br>
our nature as conscious beings.  The dawning of every new age has found<br>
expression in the works of artists working out the new aesthetic vocabulary of<br>
that age.  Because of its very nature, the artistic endeavor is best<br>
appreciated directly, rather than through textual exegesis.  Accordingly, I<br>
urge you to contemplate the flowering of Greek thought and then take a trip to<br>
Athens, or to consider the fundamental humanist breakthrough that was the<br>
Renaissance and then visit any of the northern Italian city-states or to<br>
consider the liberal revolution and then spend a day (or a lifetime) at<br>
Monticello.<br>
<p>
It is literally impossible to comprehend the real dawning of humanism and not<br>
appreciate Michelangelo's _David_.  One cannot _really_ understand the liberal<br>
ideal of the self-reliant and truly free individual without considering the<br>
gestalt of Monticello.  The strength of 17th century capitalism is nowhere<br>
better expressed than in _The Night Watch_.  A little closer to our own time,<br>
the power of frontierism doesn't really make sense until you've seen a few<br>
Remmingtons.  Likewise, the breakdown of reason in the clash between<br>
traditional values and modernism is _best_ expressed in the nihilism of much<br>
of 20th century visual art.<br>
<p>
You can't separate cause and effect in this process and thus somehow conclude<br>
that the spirit of a new age is somehow more fundamental than its artistic<br>
expression.  There is a constant feedback between idea and artistic<br>
inspiration.  The realization of the dignity of man and our ability to<br>
transcend the condemnation of superstition gave birth to Michelangelo's<br>
vision, but the expression of that vision was itself a moving impetus to the<br>
flowering of that realization. <br>
<p>
The more I think about the idea of automorph art, the more I am convinced that<br>
this idea is the core artistic expression of the transhumanist agenda.  If the<br>
urge to artistic expression is, as even the most superficial study of history<br>
clearly demonstrates, fundamental to our nature, and technological self-<br>
transformation is the core of transhumanism, then automorphism is the artistic<br>
movement of the transhumanist period.  Period.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Extropa-groups (or whatever the living communities are called).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  My wife and my children as a unit, we strive for self-improvement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  We actively seek to prepare ourselves for the future.  But we</i><br>
<i>&gt;  do not feel the need to use embody our "community" with a term</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to illustrate this.  What point does calling a group "extropa-</i><br>
<i>&gt;  something" serve?  More on this below.</i><br>
<p>
Again, history teaches that the coming of a new cultural paradigm generates<br>
social experimentation on the one hand and the desire of the first pioneers of<br>
a new memetic country to band together.  Likewise, the goal of creating "ideal<br>
communities" seems to be inherent in the enterprise of developing new ideas.  <br>
<p>
The more I read of evolutionary psychology, the less inclined I am to believe<br>
that biological humans can improve on the mating pair bond as the foundation<br>
of community.  But the mating pair bond is only the building block of<br>
community: larger structures obviously must be formed for enterprising<br>
entities to capture the benefits of division of labor.  It would be surprising<br>
indeed, given the extropian interest in spontaneous orders and agoric social<br>
structures, if we didn't experiment with new higher-order social structures.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Sex and fashion.  I visited the transhuman.org site (which I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  must profess looked more like an excuse to lock up a site name</i><br>
<i>&gt;  than a substantive information resource).  These two subjects</i><br>
<i>&gt;  were major subject areas.  I just do not see the relevance of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  even addressing sex or fashion in the same context with</i><br>
<i>&gt;  discussions about nanotechnology, AI, uploading, Singularities,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  etc.  Like art, maybe these subjects have some peripheral value,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  but elevating their status makes me wonder whether its a vision</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the future thats trying to be emphasized or just an iteration</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of alternative subculture (such as goth, cyberpunk, etc.)</i><br>
<p>
Another historical note, although perhaps a digression.  I have a fascination<br>
with the history of "fashion" seemingly inconsistent with my public persona of<br>
"Texas trial lawyer".  However that may be, the instinct to adorn seems to be<br>
near the core of our being and the universal use of "fashion" as a medium of<br>
communication cannot be doubted.  Put simply, one can tell a lot about an age<br>
by what the people in it wore.  Look at the riot of change in fashion among<br>
elites between 1400 and 1900 to see just how rapidly people's conceptions of<br>
themselves and the ideal social order was evolving.  In particular, I've<br>
always been fascinated by the period between the baroque and middle of the<br>
19th century: at the beginning of this brief 300 year period, our intellectual<br>
forbearers clothed themselves in "semiotic envelopes" or "wrappers" (as Sasha<br>
Chislenko might call them) beyond the dreams of the wildest fops of our day;<br>
by 1850 men's fashions at least had evolved to a uniformity and drabness<br>
unmatched since classical times.  In particular the period between 1790, say,<br>
and 1850, marks the adoption of an egalitarian ideal in fashion that cannot<br>
but be a reflection of the transformation of the political Zeitgeist<br>
<p>
As for the importance of sex, I commend a bit of evolutionary psychology, in<br>
particular, Buss' book, _The Evolution of Desire_ or Pinker's _How the Mind<br>
Works_.  Self-replicators of our kind are inescapably and fundamentally<br>
sexual.  The biological imperatives of our nature as sexual self-replicators<br>
are so powerful and all-pervasive that it isn't much of a stretch to see the<br>
entirety of culture as merely the thinnest garment worn by the figure of our<br>
true erotic selves.  The truth of this was glimpsed, albeit through a glass<br>
darkly, by Freud and, in so seeing we have been given tools of self-knowledge<br>
of unprecedented effect.<br>
<p>
A program of transcending our biological natures that ignored sex would be<br>
like automotive technology that ignored road-building (hmmm).  Seriously, we<br>
will be -- for the immediately foreseeable future, at least -- beings grounded<br>
in a sexual nature.  Understanding what we now are is crucial to creation of a<br>
rational plan of self-transformation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  New ways of thinking are very vulnerable to being viewed as</i><br>
<i>&gt;  cultish nonsense.  Nonsense in the vein that people seize ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that resemble salvation from present circumstances. Designated</i><br>
<i>&gt;  groups, name changing, questionable commitment to the real issues,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it sounds like a cult more than an intellectual critique of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  future (and more importantly how we can get there while also</i><br>
<i>&gt;  performing the trick of survival).  </i><br>
<p>
Thus it always has been and always will be.  Immediately behind the cutting<br>
edge will be those who grasp only part of the spirit of the new age and who<br>
seek formulae for capturing its increasingly obvious power.  Thus the now-<br>
apparent absurdity of such 18th and 19th century "scientistic" oddities as<br>
mesmerism, phrenology and primitive "social Darwinism".  That such cultish<br>
nonsense happened does not undermine the obvious power of the new age that was<br>
dawning in those times.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Drexler himself said that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  if you do not want to imperil funding sources for the various</i><br>
<i>&gt;  technical people who will be needed to make the breakthroughs</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that would harbor the future we speculate about here then:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;       "please keep the level of cultishness and bullshit down"</i><br>
<p>
Amen, brother! :-)<br>
