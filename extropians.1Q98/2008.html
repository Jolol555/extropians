<p>
Problem is, depends on who's doing the considering. Saddam's supposed<br>
capability is not being viewed as a deterrent; it's being viewed as a<br>
ticking time bomb that requires him being taken out. I absolutely agree<br>
that deterrence is a good thing. But where WOMD, especially infectious<br>
agents, are suspected, the hysteria that big states ("You can't trust<br>
Blaupunktstein, but you can trust US") can whip up is pretty daunting.<br>
<p>
And for a deterrent to be effective, it has to be known far enough in<br>
advance that adversaries are given pause. To quote from _Dr. Strangelove_<br>
(re: the SU Doomsday weapon), "...Vy DIDN'T you TELL ze VORLD, HUNH?!?"<br>
<p>
So my conclusion is that it's not subject to a clean analysis in the<br>
present Weltpolitik milieu.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; IMHO, "ye can't get there from he-ah".</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Being beyond effective force projection will require either space</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; habitation and/or advanced bulk nano defense-in-depth, IMHO.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imho, the large corps are going to get into the space first, and make sure</i><br>
<i>&gt;the next wave will encounter maximal difficulties. Maybe the next monopoly</i><br>
<i>&gt;is in the making... </i><br>
<p>
Unless they look-down/shoot-down, all they can do is make it difficult.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the</i><br>
<i>&gt;retrospective, what is your assessment whether going public (trivial</i><br>
<i>&gt;publications) first was a smart move? </i><br>
<p>
Too soon to tell. Hard to compare it to an alternate universe. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Btw nano defense-in-depth: if you can have that, flesh has obviously</i><br>
<i>&gt;become obsolete. </i><br>
<p>
I was referring to _bulk_ nano, not smart/sophisticated nano. Bulk nano, as<br>
I use the term, does not render flesh obsolete, any more than balsawood,<br>
Kevlar or synthetic sapphire do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Defense-in-depth would be part of you, and you the new</i><br>
<i>&gt;player on the scene. Expected evolutionary dynamics considered, I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;think one need to think about securety too much, then. </i><br>
<p>
You, sir, are an optimist. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Beyond not making waves: Don't concentrate in one place. Don't dig in.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Don't get press. Doing so makes one a target.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think I am stating the trivial, if I say that extropians rarely need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;interact physically. Net-crosslinked (realtime, crypted channels),</i><br>
<i>&gt;distributed networks of friends, augmented by voluntary identity</i><br>
<i>&gt;certification mechanisms (to prove you have dealt fairly in past</i><br>
<i>&gt;interactions) would seem a useful future model for us to consider. </i><br>
<p>
My comment was WRT the recurrent "let's start an island nation" theme--vide<br>
the title of this thread. Your points mirror mine. You are obviously a<br>
great thinker. :) Plus, I hear you and I share some opinions about deeply<br>
embedded systems and threaded interpretive languages. (big :)<br>
<p>
The chiefest trick in getting through the cusp, I suspect, will be not<br>
scaring the horses overmuch.<br>
The next most difficult is fostering/following the (Biblical; so sue me!<br>
:)) precept of not binding the mouths of the kine that tread the grain. My<br>
personal emphasis is on figuring out how to inoculate the 2 billion plus<br>
souls (_pace_ atheists (:)) who have never even seen a TV with the cultural<br>
ideals of self-government. But there are still a lot of oppressed people<br>
out there (and even around here), with old old grudges.<br>
