Ah, Biotime. The hype here is a bit on the over optimistic side, IMHO.<br>
<p>
I saw a demo of Hextend in freezing a hamster at the first Alcor<br>
Cryonics Festival about 2 years ago. It worked. Catch is, the amount of<br>
freezing is quite small, about -2 to -5 degrees C. I'm glad they've been<br>
able to do this with a bonobo, but it's a long, long way to -196 C.<br>
<p>
In 1966, Biotime started at about $2.00 and went up to around $30.00. I<br>
bought some at $5.00... Biotime offered some warrants at $20 - one share<br>
for every 10 that I owned. I excercised these when Biotime was around<br>
$30.00.<br>
<p>
Then it began to sag, and I put in a stop order at $25. Biotime promptly<br>
went to $ 24.50 and then rose and rose, now trading at about the<br>
equivalent of $54.00 (It split 3 to 1, so the list price is $17 at my<br>
last look). Oh well, I only made a 5 to 1 win here...<br>
<p>
What pushed Biotime into the 60s for while was that the FDA has<br>
basically approved (I am a little hazy on the details here) Hextend for<br>
further human clinical trials.<br>
<p>
Though I feel Hextend is an excellent product, I feel that its prospects<br>
are less rosy than the Biotime people say for these reasons:<br>
<p>
	1. The best so far blood extenders cost about<br>
	 $40 per liter. Biotime wants to sell Hextend<br>
	at $100 per liter.<br>
<p>
	2. The entire blood extender market is at present<br>
	 about $ 30 million per year. Biotime's book value<br>
	 is around $200 million, for a company with around<br>
	 a dozen employees. These numbers don't quite make<br>
	 sense, unless the blood extension market grows a<br>
	 lot.<br>
<p>
	3. There's a LOT of work going on for blood substitutes<br>
	 by the competition. Note that blood substitution is the<br>
	 really big market, much more than blood extension.<br>
<p>
I'll put it this way: If I hadn't sold at $25, I'd certainly sell now<br>
and wait about a year...<br>
