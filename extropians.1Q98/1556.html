<i>&gt; From:          Harvey Newstrom &lt;harv@gate.net&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In Pearson and Shaw's _Life_Extension_, they reported that low levels of</i><br>
<i>&gt; background radiation lengthened the lifespan of test animals.  Ditto</i><br>
<i>&gt; with low levels of pollution.  I think that low levels of poison</i><br>
<i>&gt; innoculate the body and trigger its immune responses.  Too much poison,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and it's bad.  Too little poison, and you have no defenses.</i><br>
<p>
I read once that at one of the early uranium mines in Europe, before <br>
they discovered all the nasty stuff radiation would do to people, the <br>
average miner -- and the average member of a miner's household -- <br>
would die of lung cancer at about age 70.  Meantime, everyone in <br>
the area who *wasn't* a uranium miner or residing with one, <br>
typically died of a wide variety of diseases at an average age of 45.<br>
