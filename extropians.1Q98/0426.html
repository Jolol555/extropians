<i>&gt; [Regarding the legal status of cloning]</i><br>
<i>&gt; As usual the popular media has latched on to this as a headline grabber</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed to attract a scientifically ignorant mass audience. Regrettably,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of the editors in the mass media seem to be as scientifically ignorant</i><br>
<i>&gt; as their readers and viewers. As to the general morality of most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; editors of the media, I somehow doubt that many of them even know the</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning of the word.</i><br>
<p>
That's not a meaningful criticism of the press; you and I personally<br>
have just about opposite definitions of "moral", yet we happen to<br>
agree (contrary to the minority) that the act of cloning yourself<br>
is OK.  The relevant question to me seems to be "What are the real<br>
memetic influences that make the majority believe what they do, and<br>
what can we do about it?"  I think blaming religion here falls<br>
short of the whole story.  Even many avowed atheists are uncomfortable<br>
with the idea.  Some who are all in favor of "technology" when it's<br>
made of plastic are less enthusiastic when it comes to cells.<br>
<p>
What is it that they fear?  What can we do to assuage that fear or<br>
(often more effective) to ridicule it?<br>
