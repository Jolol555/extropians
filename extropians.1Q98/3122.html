	At some point, someone (I think Michael Lorrey or Lee Daniel Crocker),<br>
mentioned that those states who eliminated their tradition environmental<br>
laws in favour of laws that allowed private citizens to take legal action<br>
against polluters ended up lowering their levels of pollution.  (this<br>
sounds exactly like the Coase Theorem in action)  Could someone please give<br>
me some facts and figures on this phenomenon?  <br>
	This example came up in a discussion about how the Multilateral Agreement<br>
on Investment will affect the environment.  My argument is that this treaty<br>
will force governments to get rid of their environmental laws (as these<br>
laws will put domestic companies at a disadvantage to the MAI-protected<br>
foreign companies)  Therefore, the last line of defence for the environment<br>
will be to allow private citizens to sue companies for the pollution they<br>
cause which, according to someone on this list, will actually be better for<br>
the environment.<br>
<p>
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated,<br>
<p>
Geoff.<br>
