<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn't saying "Justice is Revenge" because I think revenge is a</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; form of justice, but because I think what many people call justice</i><br>
<i>&gt; is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; simply revenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Oh, well you are right there, but that doesn't make them right. Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people think Bangladesh is somewhere in Africa. Never underestimate</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; power of human stupidity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; True.  But I've yet to hear any description of justice that doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualify as revenge.</i><br>
<p>
See below. THe difference between justice and revenge is the same<br>
difference between impartial examination of evidence and righteous<br>
predisposition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I find nothing wrong with people cooperating to rid themselves of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; common threat (in which ever way they see fit.)  But the justice</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; system goes beyond that, and creates a fixed set of threats which</i><br>
<i>&gt; are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently (whether you like it or not) for your own good.  And I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; would argue that all "punishments" are revenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Any judgement that does not a) provide proportionate compensation to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; victims, and b) rehabilitate those that are capable of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rehabilitated, while eradicating those who are not from the gene pool,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Two things:  Proportionate compensation doesn't have to involve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminal.  If I need to defend myself from someone then rehabilitation</i><br>
<i>&gt; is an option (although a difficult one.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Where is the compensation to come from if not from the convict? Anything<br>
else is not just. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; it is reestablishing the stasis in existence prior to the use of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; unjustified force.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A justified force in equal opposition reestablishes the prior state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Revenge.  You're using force against someone who you consider to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; unjust.  You can call it just or unjust all you want but the reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; you want to reestablish prior state is because you thought it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfair and you want revenge.  When in fact it is neither fair nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfair, it just is!  Besides, reestablishing the prior state isn't at</i><br>
<i>&gt; all extropian!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It sure is, if the new state is a socialistic totalatarian<br>
antitechnological fundamental islamic one.<br>
<p>
The big difference between justice and revenge is the role of passion,<br>
emotion. I can very dispassionately state, beleive and practice a policy<br>
of seeking redress and compensation for unjust confiscation and<br>
violation, without being as blinded by emotions as many people get.<br>
People who are vitimized, and are demanding the death penalty before the<br>
trial begins are seeking revenge. Those who are impartial judges,<br>
assuming innocence until judged guilty by a jury of peers, and then just<br>
as swiftly have the convict shot are seeking justice. Big difference.<br>
Those who seek revenge are righteous, and are thus prejudiced. THose who<br>
seek justice are impartial until proven otherwise by an examination of<br>
all of the relevant facts.<br>
