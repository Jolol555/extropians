Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/4/98: &lt;Maybe we all should [avoid discussing<br>
abortion] but I'm curious as to the logic behind this viewpoint (and mutual<br>
understanding often prevent further conflict).&gt;<br>
<p>
Understanding can only proceed after definitions are agreed on.  So the<br>
logic is that on core definitional issues, such as what is human and what<br>
is less than human, choices are made prior to mutual understanding.  Reason<br>
takes a back seat to values in such a choice.  Values can be chosen with<br>
the aid of reason in the form of past consequences of various options, yet<br>
reason itself cannot make the choice.  Hence my comment to Max about "whose<br>
rationality?"  It's a very old problem.  Yet even Jane Roe changed her<br>
mind, so anyone can.<br>
<p>
Because the choice of who is human and who is less than human - the old<br>
slavery issue - is so absolute, so stark in its consequences, friendships<br>
can and have been lost, even within families.  It is a civil war issue<br>
because the logic embedded within the culture of death demands that<br>
everyone, not just a jurisdiction here and there, but everyone partake in<br>
it.  If death is the means by rule and not exception to implement the good<br>
- abortion, assisted suicide, euthanasia, execution, genocide, etc. - then<br>
no competing jurisdictions can be allowed to show the subject population an<br>
alternative which would uphold the values of promoting and enhancing life. <br>
The comparisons between the pathology of societies within the culture of<br>
death and the health and vitality of societies within the culture of life<br>
are too stark and cannot be allowed.<br>
<p>
As we slip closer and closer to a world governemnt of some sort or another,<br>
there will be no place on earth left to move to in order to escape the<br>
culture of death.  The impetus towards world government is from oligarchs<br>
concerned most of all with world demographics, the UN Cairo Depopulation<br>
Conference made that abundantly clear.  They must impose abortion, etc. on<br>
everyone, there must be no alternative to the global unity they envision. <br>
As I have previously written, there is no compromise or accommodation<br>
possible between extropic worldviews and entropic worldviews.  The entropic<br>
worldview spreading globally today is primarily an urban, moneyed<br>
phenomenon.  I like Spengler's word for it, "unfertility."  It happens<br>
sooner or later everywhere urbanization develops.  Having children is<br>
simply viewed as too expensive, inconvenient, or pointless.  Defining the<br>
unborn child away, the developing self, is a sleight of hand to get away<br>
with murder.  Death, whether via barbaric nihilism or via tyrannical order,<br>
takes center stage and remains there, crowding out all alternatives.<br>
<p>
&lt;Now you are forcing your definition of what a human being is on us.&gt;<br>
<p>
The reality is just the opposite, you and your fellow travelers have forced<br>
it on us.  We can't find a jurisdiction to escape it.  In response to this<br>
absolutism, we must organize and fight.  This is memetic selection in<br>
action.<br>
<p>
&lt;A 2 week old fetus is not a person in my book, it has the potential of<br>
becoming a person.&gt;<br>
<p>
And your book has been forced on us.  A 2 week old fetus is a developing<br>
person, just as an 80 year old is a developing person.<br>
<p>
&lt;I don't claim to know what the definition of a human is but I'm pretty<br>
sure<br>
you and I are human.&gt;<br>
<p>
I do know.  It is different than yours, whether you know what yours is or<br>
not, yet yours has been forced on us, to the great detriment of society in<br>
the quarter century since Roe v. Wade.<br>
<p>
&lt;I fully realize this is a mess from a philosophical standpoint, but then,<br>
so is real life.&gt;<br>
<p>
My real life isn't a mess, I certainly can't speak for yours.  Nor is this<br>
a mess from my philosophical standpoint, but I see clearly that it is from<br>
your philosophical standpoint.<br>
<p>
&lt;It seems to be broadly accepted (in Europe anyway) and makes for a<br>
_workable_ rule.&gt;<br>
<p>
Europe is always at least a generation farther down the slope than America.<br>
 And workable for who, the slaughtered innocents, the victims of Europe's<br>
genteel holocaust?<br>
<p>
James Rogers wrote 3/3/98 (and Mr. Kamphuis chimed in on the same point):<br>
&lt;What 50% are digital systems missing?  Digital systems have the same<br>
resolution/perception capability as analog systems within the limits of the<br>
noise floor (which affects analog systems as well).  There is nothing<br>
analog that can not be represented digitally within the limits of the<br>
analog system.  There are well known methods for reading and storing<br>
arbitrary precision analog values with digital devices as primitive as a<br>
1-bit signal converters.&gt;<br>
<p>
"Within the limits of the noise floor" is a cute way of pretending that the<br>
noise floor doesn't count, yet half of reality is hidden away there. <br>
Analog systems are affected by noise floor, yes, they don't pretend it<br>
away.  "Represented digitally with the limits of the analog system" is<br>
another cute way of saying that the representation of reality is good<br>
enough, yet half of reality goes unrepresented.  "Reading and storing<br>
arbitrary precision analog values with digital devices" is another cute way<br>
of saying that arbitrary precision is good enough for government work.  Why<br>
settle for arbitrary precision, which cannot be precise enough for<br>
consciousness to work, why not go for all of reality?<br>
<p>
Arjen Kamphuis wrote 3/3/98: &lt;I don't think comparing womans clinics to<br>
nazi-death camps is appropriate.&gt;<br>
<p>
The very large 'right to life' worldwide movement routinely refers to the<br>
on-going tragedy of mothers murdering their unborn children as the<br>
"holocaust."  If you are unaware of this, you must get your news from the<br>
orthodox media which does its best to delegitimize opposition to the<br>
culture of death.  "In lieu of stake and faggots, there is the great<br>
silence." - Oswald Spengler<br>
<p>
&lt;Certain people on this list might get extremely upset.&gt;<br>
<p>
At least they survived their mother's pregnancy to enjoy being upset.<br>
<p>
&lt;From the perspective of the fetus it is irrelevant whether it is a pig or<br>
a human, up to a point.  And somewhere before this point abortion becomes<br>
illegal. The fetus now has the status of human with all the usual rights<br>
attached.&gt;<br>
<p>
Not in America.  In America, abortion is legal on demand right through nine<br>
months, in fact, right up to having the baby 2/3 out of the birth canal on<br>
its due date.  No legislative process was involved in this, no consensus,<br>
no will of the people, just top-down imposed death worship by five<br>
unelected judges, stripping all sovereign rights that individual states<br>
constitutionally have in this matter.<br>
<p>
&lt;As long as you keep clouding the issue by calling abortion 'murder' this<br>
is not going anywhere.&gt;<br>
<p>
I am clarifying the issue, not clouding it.  You are clouding it by<br>
pretending that a developing person is not a developing person so that<br>
murder can be legitimized.<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Are you saying that the possession of intelligence is the source of<br>
rights?&gt;<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;The ability to have Intelligence &amp; consiousness.&gt;<br>
<p>
And who determines whether ability is there or not, at what threshold of<br>
ability?  Which individuals grant us our rights?  Can I talk to them?<br>
<p>
&lt;All consious beings should be treated with respect whether they are<br>
humans, dolphins or computers.&gt;<br>
<p>
Why should I?  Who says so?<br>
<p>
&lt;IN many other countries there is and there is a _very_ clear distiction<br>
between an aborted fetus and human excrement.&gt;<br>
<p>
An echo of a conscience, perhaps?<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;What's wrong with cannabilism?&gt;<br>
<p>
AK: &lt;Nothing (did you see 'Alive'). The problem is the killing part, not<br>
the<br>
eating part.&gt;<br>
<p>
On behalf of civilization, let me say "Ick!"<br>
<p>
&lt;...a baby gains certain rights beyond a specific number of weeks after<br>
conception. This is not perfect from an ethical viewpoint, but it is<br>
workable.&gt;<br>
<p>
Again, workable for who?  The unborn baby?<br>
