In a message dated 98-02-15 17:18:37 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; <br>
 Really, I'm having trouble following you. Because I'm not concerned <br>
 about Clinton's affairs, therefore I'm not concerned about food <br>
 poisoning? Come on now!<br>

The point is not that youre not concerned about his affairs....neither am I.<br>
He could parade a whole troop of girl scouts thru his office for all I care.<br>
The point is that he lies about it.  If he lies about one thing then I expect<br>
that he lies about other things as well.  The relevant topic at the moment<br>
being a crying need (so he says) to bomb Iraq.  <br>
<p>
And I am NO fan of big government.  I HATE it with a passion.  I AM a fan of<br>
free markets...and agree that it has probably never existed.  It's all to easy<br>
for some thug with a gun (or club, or whatever) to come in a pronounce himself<br>
(king, god, pope, cheif,....etc.)  What I'm trying to do is point out that<br>
government in general...this administration in particular....can't be trusted.<br>
Because EVERYTHING they say is possibly...probably? (how do you know?)...a<br>
lie.<br>
