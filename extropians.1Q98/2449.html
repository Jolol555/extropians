<i>&gt;Not in America. In America, abortion is legal on demand right through nine</i><br>
<i>&gt;months, in fact, right up to having the baby 2/3 out of the birth canal on</i><br>
<i>&gt;its due date. No legislative process was involved in this, no consensus,</i><br>
<i>&gt;no will of the people, just top-down imposed death worship by five</i><br>
<i>&gt;unelected judges, stripping all sovereign rights that individual states</i><br>
<i>&gt;constitutionally have in this matter.</i><br>
<p>
While I have some sympathy for those who argue vocally on this<br>
matter--as I have argued similarly against the even more barbaric<br>
and useless form of child abuse called circumcision--I do not have<br>
any respect for those who use outright lies in their arguments.<br>
You know very well that the above statement is false, or else you<br>
haven't even read Roe v. Wade, and are therefore unqualified to<br>
comment upon it (and it was 7-2, not 5-4).<br>
<p>
That decision--wich is still the controlling law of the land--says<br>
that in the /first trimester only/, the state may not interfere<br>
with a woman's choice to abort; in the second trimester, a state<br>
may place limits on it; in the third, any state may ban abortion<br>
entirely, and many have.  There are some states who have not<br>
banned third-trimester abortions, but even there they are extremely<br>
rare.  They are certainly not available "on demand" anywhere.<br>
<p>
As long as I'm posting in this thread, I might as well get my<br>
opinion out there: if you ask me, it is profoundly insulting to<br>
the wonderful qualities that make humans unique and precious--<br>
reason, achievement, passion, creativity--to grant similar legal<br>
status to a lump of undifferentiated cells that cannot be in any<br>
way argued to have those properties.  Do I think that there is<br>
some point along the development of those cells at which they<br>
begin to take on those properties worth protecting?  Certainly.<br>
I even have little problem with those who would say that it<br>
happens at some point before birth: but choosing conception as<br>
that point is scientifically absurd and insulting.  If you want<br>
to argue about the precious value of life, then do so rationally;<br>
learn some real data about the gestation process and argue about<br>
when things like suffering, creativity, or volition might become<br>
possible.  You undermine your argument by choosing such an<br>
arbitrary and meaningless point as conception.<br>
