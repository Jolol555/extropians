<i>&gt; foreign companies)  Therefore, the last line of defence for the environment</i><br>

Yes, this would be good, however, then corporations would lobby for tort reform,<br>
since foreign countries without populations concerned about the environment (or<br>
without a voice to air those concerns) would still be havens for corporations to<br>
manufacture toxic intensive products in. Unless there are either international<br>
environmental laws with teeth put into force, or unless nations are willing to allow<br>
foreigners to sue for damages to the environment as a whole, then the only real<br>
solution would be to force all products imported to have been produced in plants that<br>
meet the same environmental standards as domestically produced products. In this<br>
manner, the nation with the most strict reg wins.<br>
<p>
Another possibility is to allow consumers to sue the distributors of foreign made<br>
products for their part in the externalization of costs that is inherent in<br>
pollution.<br>
<p>
Another solution would be to tax products based on the energy input and waste<br>
produced to manufacture it. Products sold would then have to bear a label<br>
identifying, like a USRDA label on foods, the energy and pollution 'content' of the<br>
product.<br>
<p>
Note that all of these, with the exception of the second to last one, require large<br>
government administration, so naturally, I don't like them. The last one could<br>
possibly be performed by an independent inspection corporation like UL or Consumer<br>
Testing, rather than by government agencies.<br>
