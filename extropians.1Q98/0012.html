<p>
We might be able to do even better. Have a special-purpose machine <br>
that scans your mind and gives as output a binary answer to whether <br>
you are responsible or not. Then the memory of this machine is <br>
automatically erased and only the output remains. The subject to be <br>
investigated can be allowed to make any arrangements necessary to <br>
verify the validity and confidentiality of the proceedure.<br>
<p>
Suppose such a machine existed for deciding with 100% accuracy <br>
whether somebody had commited a certain crime. It would then be hard <br>
to argue that the law enforcing agency did not have the right to <br>
apply this technique to any subject it wanted to (provided that it <br>
was quick and had no side effects). For to refuse the law enforcing <br>
agency the unlimited right to use this technique would be equivalent <br>
to refusing it to maximise its detection rate of criminals, even when <br>
no externalities were involved. What legitimate reason could anybody <br>
have for not wanting the law enforcing agency scan his mind with this <br>
device in order to find out if he had commited a crime?<br>
<p>
Or do we perhaps *want* a certain failure rate of the law enforcing <br>
system, so that if the political systems lead to really screwed up <br>
laws, there will at least be some chance of escaping them and perhaps <br>
starting a revolution. Is criminality a little bit like random noice, <br>
so that a certain amount is beneficial since it makes the system less <br>
likely to get stuck in a "local maximum"?<br>
