Well, I found a picture in a book about the brain, It was a scan.<br>
You could see very clearly how the blood had build up between<br>
the skull and the brain. I agree that this could be a bit missleading<br>
since this doesn't tell you what happens if something breaks inside <br>
brain. <br>

Yes, I agree. Anders help us out here.<br>
Is it worth the effort to drill hole's :-)<br>

<p>
You are right of course; it should add a great deal of value<br>
in saving you from possible brain-damage, to give up all this.<br>
I don't have a clue what the chance is of getting a stoke.<br>
They had an advertising campaign in Holland recently regarding<br>
this, and they claimed something like the second place on the<br>
"what can happen to you list....". But the actual numbers<br>
slipped my mind.<br>
