Hal,<br>
<p>
Thanks for including my first name multiple times in your tasteful and<br>
empirical viewpoint of the pseudo-science culture.<br>
<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I don't know enough about what he's written to form any solid<br>
opinions, nor have I viewed his videos. I simply find the 'concepts' engaging<br>
and it is not completely important whether they are valid observations. I've<br>
listened to him speak a few times and I have to say, he's a bit of a nutter.<br>
But he's still *very* entertaining. (-:<br>
<p>
btw Hal, Hoagland is "a well known space expert." If what he claims is true,<br>
he's consulted with NASA for a long time. Perhaps not recently, but certainly<br>
at one time.<br>
<p>
You know this really brings up another question: "How many of you believe in<br>
the existence of extra terrestrial biological entities?"<br>
<p>
I'm not asking this as a UFO nut, I'm sure by this time I must sound like<br>
one. I'm just curious how many of you REALLY believe its likely we're not<br>
alone.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I read Hoagland's book about Cydonia many years ago, and it was completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; unconvincing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem is that the shapes are not obviously artificial.  Yes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; some of them are roughly pyramidal, but I can find rocks that have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; similar shape.  You have to look at the weathering and erosion and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; factors that carve these rocks.  The Martian experts who have done so</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that these shapes are the products of natural erosion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jeff also mentions Hoagland's video tape analysis of events on a 1991</i><br>
<i>&gt; space shuttle flight.  This is STS-48, and a good resource for information</i><br>
<i>&gt; about the controversy is <a href="http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/sts-48.html">http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/sts-48.html</a>.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can read there the questionable reasoning of the UFO believers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; James Oberg, a well known space expert, says that all the video shows is</i><br>
<i>&gt; particles near the shuttle being pushed by its thrusters.  See Oberg's</i><br>
<i>&gt; analysis at <a href="http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/oberg.html">http://web2.airmail.net/yogi/oberg.html</a>.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hoagland's web site at <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com">http://www.enterprisemission.com</a> claimed shortly</i><br>
<i>&gt; after the Mars rover landed that they had found all kinds of artifacts in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the surface pictures: military vehicles, technical equipment, cannisters</i><br>
<i>&gt; of various sorts.  Everyone else just sees rocks.  Hoagland has also</i><br>
<i>&gt; claimed to have seen a crystal city on the moon by enhancing Apollo</i><br>
<i>&gt; images.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; In my mind, Hoagland has no credibility.  He may be deluding himself,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or he may just be deluding others, but either way he is not a reliable</i><br>
<i>&gt; source of information.</i><br>
