How about a small chemical heater of some sort that cleanly and<br>
efficiently metabolizes some substance and generates heat as a<br>
byproduct? Like an ideal fuel cell? Humans maintain an average body<br>
temp of 98.6F from metabolizing a variety of molecules broken<br>
down from food substances; couldn't something much much simpler<br>
than a life form perform something similar for the specific purpose<br>
of generating varying levels of heat efficiently? Is breaking down<br>
water from melting snow, slowly burning the H and exhausting the O2<br>
possible in a tiny device with today's tech? This would seem a<br>
practical level of tech for camping in cold environments with<br>
moisture in some form present.<br>
<p>
One problem I see with the "mister fusion" idea is what are the<br>
consequences of pitching the product in the garbage? Would even<br>
nanotech be able to break down all of the elements in the device?<br>
At the very least, you would have to have nanotech for the assembly<br>
and breakdown of such devices; even if the devices themselves were<br>
relatively safe, mass-producing and disposing of them using today's<br>
technology would probably be extremely hazardous.<br>
<p>
Not to mention the PR issues revolving around the safety factor of<br>
little Johnny cranking up the heat and slamming the thing with a<br>
hammer. Even if the device itself were 100% safe, along with the<br>
production and disposal (assuming nanotech), any of the words<br>
associated with "nuclear" or "fusion" would probably keep it off<br>
the market long after it first technologically viable to safetly<br>
make and sell. People heavily protested a little battery being<br>
lobbed into the void of space (the Cassini Saturn probe).<br>
<p>
Although it might be hard to make money off of (legally), there's<br>
probably nothing to prevent hobbyist from downloading the specs<br>
for the device and nano-assembling it themselves, assuming the<br>
proper element(s) could be obtained (that's probably the sticky<br>
issue that opens a really really big can of worms: if it were<br>
easy, then why not a 100mton explosive device?...). Laws may not<br>
be as strict outside Earth's biosphere, but then who would want<br>
to manufacture personal heater devices "out there" unless they<br>
could sell them "here" or other places for use in uncontrolled<br>
temperature environments (like the surfaces of planets)?...<br>
<p>
Technology-wise, Mr. Fusion is a great idea.  ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've heard that traditional Korean houses are heated by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; wood-burning stove under the house whose chimney is a meandering</i><br>
<i>&gt; ceramic pipe buried in the floor. A high-tech version of this might</i><br>
<i>&gt; let you put the burner outside the tent while still getting nearly</i><br>
<i>&gt; all the heat into the tent.</i><br>
<p>
That's sounds like a good innovation that could be applied for<br>
today's camping gear. You might even invert this: have the (tiny)<br>
heater sit inside the tent, and have small, flexible, insolated<br>
pipes (hoses?) vent in air and out exhaust. Or would this be<br>
an unworkable contraption on the small-scale? Maybe an arctic<br>
survival heater similar to this already exists? Or would this be<br>
an unworkable contraption on the small-scale?<br>
