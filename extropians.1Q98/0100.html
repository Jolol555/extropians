<i>&gt; I have been wondering about living for ever and ever. That if I was</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Wouldn't life at some point get boring?</i><br>
<p>
That depends on what you fill it with. <br>
<p>
But your argument clearly shows why just uploading somebody into a<br>
hyper-computer won't make them a transcendent superbeing by "quickly"<br>
(from an outside perspective) upgrading themselves (as has been<br>
previously argued on this list): most likely they will become bored or<br>
distracted long before they can modify themselves not to become bored<br>
and distracted.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As I am now, the only things that i find interesting are the things I</i><br>
<i>&gt; find hard.</i><br>
<p>
See the work on the "flow expeprience" by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. He<br>
points out that the truly rewarding things are things are activities<br>
that demand out full attention, but not harder than we can manage. Of<br>
course, as we do them our experience and skill grows.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find things interesting right now that animals doesn't. Storytelling,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Pretty pictures, music, science, philosophy, mathematics (well sort of),</i><br>
<i>&gt; Probably as a &gt;H i will find things interesting too that I can't even</i><br>
<i>&gt; comprehend or fathom right now. Therefore I think it will be a long time</i><br>
<i>&gt; before I will get bored.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus Max M's first rule of &gt;H ;-) is:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As i get more intelligent and understands the problems I currently have,</i><br>
<i>&gt; i will find new and interesting problems.</i><br>
<p>
Very true. Just look at what we enjoy now that we as children would<br>
have found utterly boring or incomprehensible. The more I learn about<br>
the world, the more interesting it becomes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I Look forward to chess being as transparent to me as tic tac toe is</i><br>
<i>&gt; right now, and me playing some kind of 1000'th dimensional checkers.</i><br>
<p>
I wonder if 1000-dimensional checkers isn't trivial; many problems<br>
seem to become simpler the more dimensions we add. But that may be<br>
because we cannot deal with or see the real problems that appear in<br>
1000-dimensional spaces, so we just notice the simple ones.<br>
