<p>
True. Perhaps neurons age because the support they receive from other cells <br>
that do divide degrades, or perhaps telomere shorting is not the only clock  <br>
in every cell, but if one clock can be found so can another.<br>

              <br>
<p>
Geron also has a patent on a telomerase inhibitor. Except for sperm and eggs <br>
most cells don't produce telomerase (some cells lining the stomach and <br>
intestine produce a little, but not enough to become immortal) so this <br>
inhibitor shouldn't have many side effects, but all known cancers produce <br>
lots of it. Geron has a sensitive method for detecting telomerase and hopes to <br>
use it to diagnose cancer. The company also wants to develop its telomerase <br>
inhibitor into a cancer treatment, if it works it would turn our worst enemy <br>
into a friend, a fast growing cancer would die of old age.<br>
<p>
On Tuesday when Geron made the announcement that they had made human cells <br>
immortal its stock jumped up by 44%, does anybody have an opinion about Geron  <br>
as an investment?<br>
