 I hope my criticism didn't convince you that debating fundamental ideas<br>
is futile. Many attempts use futile approaches, such as rephrasing ideas<br>
their opponents have already rejected. If you want to alter your opponents<br>
beliefs (rather than promote solidarity within your side of the debate, as<br>
many arguments seem designed for), you need to understand why they reach<br>
different conclusions than you, which requires a genuine interest in how<br>
they think.<br>

 People whose moral views are as fully formed as they will ever be<br>
have lost the capacity to improve themselves.<br>

<p>
 My moral beliefs are ultimately based on utilitarian arguments (e.g.<br>
comparisons such as the U.S. vs. the Soviet Union have shown that the<br>
rule "if in doubt, avoid coercion" produces results that almost all<br>
humans prefer). I see no sign that disagreements about things like<br>
whether torture is nice explain much of the political disputes we see<br>
(I think Robin Hanson has a paper on his web site arguing this better<br>
than I can).<br>
 I would be curious to hear whether you have a justification for a<br>
religious-style attitude towards moral rules, or whether your "coercion<br>
is immoral" rule is merely shorthand for something like "I've studied<br>
enough history to know that all coercion that has been tried in societies<br>
like ours has been unneccesary and has produced undesired results, and<br>
we should avoid coercion until we hear a fundamentally new argument for it".<br>
