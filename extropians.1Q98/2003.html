Cloning technique allows bones<br>
to regenerate after cancer, fractures <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 15 — Scientists are nearing the day when they will be<br>
able to regenerate bone in people who suffer fractures, lose bone due to<br>
cancer or are disfigured by facial defects. And while the day when they can<br>
mend a broken heart is still years into the future, researchers predicted<br>
Sunday that cardiac tissue will also someday be regenerated, redefining old<br>
age as we know it. <br>
 <br>
     <br>
 The technique makes the current methods of transplanting bone tissue from<br>
either a cadaver or from another part of the body seem barbaric, one<br>
researcher said. <br>
<p>
         THE NOVEL APPROACH involves using cloned genes and smart grafts to<br>
foster bone regrowth in the area of injury, said Cato Laurencin of<br>
Allegheny University Hospitals in Philadelphia. <br>
       Known as tissue engineering, the technique was made possible by the<br>
cloning of genes that produce a natural growth factor that allows bone<br>
cells to sprout where only dead tissue had been before.<br>
       So far, the new strategy is working, growing new bone in injured<br>
rats and rabbits within a matter of weeks, Laurencin told a scientific<br>
meeting in Philadelphia. Human testing is expected within five years.<br>
       The technique makes the current methods of transplanting bone tissue<br>
from either a cadaver or from another part of the body seem barbaric, he said.<br>
       And within a decade or two, he said, similar methods will be used to<br>
repair muscle, heart and other injured tissues. “As we move into the next<br>
millennium, tissue engineering is going to revolutionize the repair,<br>
restoration and regeneration of all types of body tissues.”<br>
       <br>
STIMULATING BONE GROWTH<br>
       The simplicity of the system is particularly noteworthy. A disciple<br>
of what he calls the Volkswagen approach, Laurencin said, “You don’t need a<br>
very complex system to stimulate blood vessels and bone growth. What we<br>
need is a graft for all the people.” <br>
       The scenario, he said, would be something like this: First, some of<br>
the patient’s healthy cells are removed by a simple needle biopsy. Then,<br>
the cells and the cloned growth factor genes are implanted together into a<br>
graft whose appearance he likened to a crouton.<br>
       As the cells begin to divide, the cloned genes begin producing the<br>
growth factor protein needed for healing. Each time the cells divide, more<br>
growth factor is produced; the process is allowed to continue for several<br>
days before the entire complex is transplanted into the area of injury.<br>
       Once transplanted, the grafts, grown on a scaffold composed of smart<br>
materials that biodegrade in the body in a matter of weeks, continue to<br>
release the growth factor, sprouting blood vessels at the injured site. The<br>
blood vessels, in turn, provide nourishment to the stem cells that are<br>
constantly being produced by our bone marrow, Laurencin said, and bone<br>
cells proliferate.<br>
       A patient’s graft is made from any of three compounds of varying<br>
strengths that form a continuum from materials like those of the newer<br>
sutures that dissolve in the body in a few days to smarter compounds<br>
similar to the Kevlar used in bullet-proof vests. <br>
       A person with a simple finger fracture, for example, needs a less<br>
durable graft that would dissolve in the body within six weeks, Laurencin<br>
said, while a broken hip would require a graft that would last six months<br>
or more.<br>
       <br>
LESS PAIN, LESS RISK<br>
       The method is not only associated with less pain and fewer<br>
complications than methods now used to treat bone loss, he said, but solves<br>
the problem of supply that now limits them.<br>
       Currently, a person with a crushing arm bone injury, for example,<br>
has two choices: painful surgery in which a bone graft is taken from the<br>
hip or a graft from a cadaver. The former often leaves the patient with an<br>
agonizing limp, he said, while the latter can transmit viral diseases. Both<br>
are in limited supply.<br>
       All these problems are obviated through tissue engineering,<br>
Laurencin said.<br>
       But even more exciting, said fellow engineer Thomas Budinger, is the<br>
possibility of using bioengineering to regenerate heart tissue.<br>
       Even if not stricken by a disease such as cancer or a heart attack,<br>
a person eventually dies due to old age — his heart tissue simply becomes<br>
too old to function, said Budinger, of the Lawrence Berkeley National<br>
Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. <br>
       But if heart tissue can be rejuvenated, he said, the healthy elderly<br>
could expect to add decades to their lives.<br>
