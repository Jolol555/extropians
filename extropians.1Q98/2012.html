<p>
&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/underline&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/italic&gt;<br>
<p>
Recent Scientific breakthroughs suggest that the manipulation of the genetic instructions passed to our children is much nearer than previously assumed.  It is time for scientists and ethicists to take a fresh look at the possibilities human germline manipulation may bring, and the challenges it may pose.  This symposium, by providing a realistic scientific assessment of the technology's potential over the next twenty years and reflecting on these possibilities is meant to serve as a foundation for the approaching public-policy debate.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;The Program is sponsored by grants from The Greenwall Foundation and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.<br>

<p>
&lt;/bigger&gt;Welcome and Introduction&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;-&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;Gregory Stock<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt; 	An evolutionary perspective on germline engineering and the interplay between human biology and technology.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;A Vision for Practical Human Germline Engineering&lt;/color&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;8080,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt; &lt;/color&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- John Campbell<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	Germline engineering may enable us to obtain the benefits of a century of genetic science. We now have the capacity to develop techniques to reliably and safely introduce DNA constructs into germ cells and could begin to conceive and design genetic therapies to ward off diseases and improve the quality of human life. This talk discusses how a program for human germline engineering might be structured and some of the technical hurdles it would face.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;The Human Genome Project, Launch Pad for Human Genetic Engineering&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- Leroy Hood<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	Our ability to manipulate our genetics will be profoundly extended by the successful completion of the human genome project. What therapeutic enhancements to our genes might be feasible two decades from now? How close might we be to constructively altering the genes for our immune system, our development, and our nervous system? What role might biotechnology companies play in generating the knowledge and technology for human germline engineering and making it broadly available?<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;Ethics and Safety&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- Daniel Koshland, Jr.<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	Efforts to engineer the human germline need to satisfy appropriate ethical and safety requirements. What level of testing should be required before germline procedures are used with humans? How do the individual and global risks from human germline engineering compare with other medical and reproductive risks? Should guidelines be developed to regulate the methods by which the human genome is manipulated or merely the types of genetic changes allowed?<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;The Genetic Engineer's Tool Box&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- Mario R. Capecchi<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	Various procedures have vastly expanded our ability to manipulate the genome and further advances can be expected during the next two decades.  This talk examines the techniques used to engineer genetic changes in various organisms and considers their technical potential for refinement into tools for safe, reliable germline engineering in humans. The potential scope of human germline manipulations in coming generations is also considered.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;A New Front in the Battle Against Disease&lt;/color&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;8080,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt; &lt;/color&gt;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- W. French Anderson<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	Introducing healthy genes into diseased somatic cells is becoming an established medical practice. How big a step would it be to extend such therapy to germline cells? For which categories of disease might germline engineering be superior to such alternatives as somatic cell therapy, embryo selection, and traditional medical treatment? What new approaches to disease diagnosis and treatment might germline engineering offer us in two decades?<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;Aging: a Target for Germline Engineering&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- Michael Rose<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	Aging is multifaceted, affected by individual genes, interacting gene complexes, and environmental influences. This talk reviews our current understanding of the genetic factors which affect aging, considers how this knowledge may increase in the next two decades, and assesses the prospects of germline engineering both for ameliorating the degenerative changes that accompany aging and for retarding the aging process itself.<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,ffff&lt;/param&gt;In-Vitro Fertilization:  From Embryo Selection to Genetic Design&lt;/color&gt; &lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,8080,8080&lt;/param&gt;- Lee Silver<br>
<p>
&lt;/color&gt;	In-vitro fertilization will soon offer many possible new twists to traditional human reproduction, from chimeric babies and children born to their grandparents, to detailed screening of individual embryos.  This talk explores these possibilities, looking at how sophisticated such technologies as embryo screening might soon become, and how they might relate to germline engineering.<br>
<p>
