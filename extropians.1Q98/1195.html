Regarding the worry and concern of cheap food.<br>
<p>
Please explain why for several decades and currently the Government is<br>
involved in PRICE SUPPORT?  In a free market given todays technology the cost<br>
of agricultural products would be much less than it currently is...else why<br>
the current price support structure?<br>
<p>
Also...we're no where near being short on land...I drive across Arizona, New<br>
Mexico, Nevada etc about once a weekly lately...theres LOTS of open land out<br>
there..some places it's a hundred miles between habitations...(desert)<br>
....just needs a little water is all...seems a pipeline system from say...the<br>
great lakes? would be money better spent than veggie high rises.<br>
<p>
Agricultural skyscrapers is all very nice...unless you've worked in the<br>
agricultural business in the past...then it seems awfully impracticle.<br>
Consider all that's involved in ......wheat production for<br>
instance....planting, growing (weeding, feeding, watering), harvesting.<br>
<p>
I currently have two John Deere on my trailer, enroute to California.  Big<br>
Brutes...able to plow square miles per day.  It'd take SOME skyscraper to<br>
match the surface area these guys can cover....and then after the harvest<br>
..(harvest is a messy business)...you gonna process the wheat in the middle of<br>
the city?<br>
<p>
I encounter a multitude of silly rules designed to keep machinery (my truck)<br>
OUT of cities...I don't think that mindset is gonna change any time soon.<br>
<p>
I'm NOT saying it COULDN'T happen...I just think it unlikely given the infra<br>
structure changes need and the less than obvious benefits...(and I think if it<br>
did.....it'd be a pyramid...perhaps a MONSTER arcology)<br>
<p>
Oh...by the way...with an increase in CO2 content in the air...farming becomes<br>
more effecient...less land needed for more crops....(lets hear it for Global<br>
Warming!!!!!)<br>
