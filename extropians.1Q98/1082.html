<i>&gt; start with some definitions of optimality that assume what you're </i><br>

<i>&gt; the statist schemes that have been tried. Without at least the germ of </i><br>
<i>&gt; a workable idea, you're asking us to look for a chimera.</i><br>
<p>
It isn't at all hard to come up with a system that works better in <br>
theory than free market capitalism works in reality.<br>
<p>
The problem is in implementing the theory.  Every such system I have <br>
seen works great if the average joe on the street is omniscient and <br>
omnibenevolent (omnipotent is not required), or if a sufficient <br>
number of such people exist along with a 100% reliable method of <br>
selecting them for management positions.<br>
<p>
(I want to mention that in such an environment, free-market <br>
capitalism also works really well.)<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, we don't operate in such an environment.<br>
<p>
Free-market capitalism survives mistakes better than any other system <br>
yet tried to the same degree of purity.  This is largely because it <br>
inherently contains rigorous, constant, automatic (but not <br>
necessarily fast -- oh well) correction mechanisms that are firmly <br>
rooted in human nature.  (There are other reasons, but that's the <br>
biggest and most essential one.)  <br>
<p>
Therefore, in evaluating the <br>
applicability of any new proposal for the arrangement of an economic <br>
system, we can begin by looking for equivalent correction mechanisms; <br>
if we don't find them, we can (assuming strictly logical <br>
debate) discard that proposal without further consideration.<br>
<p>
Socialism fails and should be discarded.  Unfortunately the debate is <br>
*not* strictly logical, so we must continue.<br>
<p>
Next we look at the source of growth, and we find that it lies <br>
overwhelmingly in individuals acting for their own profit -- however <br>
those individuals may define profit.  So if a proposed economic <br>
system is intended to provide growth -- a wonderful idea unless you <br>
intend the population to remain stable or shrink and further have <br>
protection against natural disasters so you never have to rebuild <br>
anything -- we look for ways that individuals can act for their own <br>
profit.  If these are nonexistent or insignificant, then the proposal <br>
fails.<br>
<p>
Socialism fails and should be discarded.<br>
<p>
And third we look at how it happens that people do what the system <br>
says they should do.  Free-market capitalism says people should <br>
decide for themselves what to do.  Even if one slavishly follows some <br>
economic or spiritual guru, one has chosen for oneself to do so.  No <br>
problem.  All other systems require that people be persuaded or <br>
coerced, and the cost of this persuasion or coercion -- combined with <br>
the fact that neither the persuasion nor the coercion nor any <br>
combination of the two will be 100% successful -- is a drag on the <br>
system.<br>
<p>
Socialism has the problem that those who don't do as the system <br>
commands, come to possess more resources per capita than those who <br>
do.  This means that persuasion will be of decreasing value, and <br>
coercion will require an increasing fraction of the <br>
resources possessed by those who behave as socialism demands.  So <br>
again socialism as a system fails and not only should, but inevitably <br>
will, be discarded.<br>
<p>
Note: this does *not* address a *voluntary* socialist enclave in a <br>
free-market capitalist system.  Such enclaves can be reasonably <br>
stable and reasonably successful.  <br>
