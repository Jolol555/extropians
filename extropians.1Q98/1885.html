Sure!  The complex designs in biodiversity, based on billions of years<br>
of thorough testing, clearly present a large possible value.  I'm<br>
arguing against the claim that, if biodiversity in the wild were largely<br>
eliminated, human culture would be destroyed or even suffer significant<br>
losses from its present and probable near-future conditions.<br>
<p>
The scare tactic "save the wild environment or we're all gonna die!"<br>
is bogus and, as such, will fail in the end.  Saving biodiversity<br>
needs to be based on more substantial values, such as economic<br>
efficiency, aesthetics, and the potential for new discoveries.<br>
If the movement to save biodiversity is based on solid ground,<br>
it will succeed; otherwise it's likely to get ploughed under unless<br>
it becomes a religion.  That would bring its own set of problems.<br>
