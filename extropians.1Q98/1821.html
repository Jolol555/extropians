<i>&gt; Wistar Scientist Invited To Speak On Regeneration At National</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Meeting Of American Association For The Advancement Of Science</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Philadelphia -- Ellen Heber-Katz, Ph.D., a professor and immunologist at The Wistar Institute, has been invited to speak at</i><br>
<i>&gt;        the 165th national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Her presentation on The</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Genetics of Tissue Repair and Regeneration in Mice will be one of only seven science topical lectures designed to highlight</i><br>
<i>&gt;        emerging and innovative research. Prior to her presentation, Dr. Heber-Katz will participate in a 50-minute news briefing</i><br>
<i>&gt;        with reporters.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The AAS meeting and Science Innovation Exposition will be held from February 12-17, 1998 in Philadelphia -- where its</i><br>
<i>&gt;        first meeting was held 150 years ago. It is the scientific community's most visible forum for increasing the public's</i><br>
<i>&gt;        understanding of science.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Dr. Heber-Katz's presentation will focus on the mouse she and her research team discovered, which is the first potentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;        useful model for studying epimorphic (limb) regeneration in humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Until now, it has been possible to study regeneration only in amphibians, which are biologically, genetically and</i><br>
<i>&gt;        immunologically different from mammals. "Despite those limitations," says Dr. Heber-Katz, "there has been impressive</i><br>
<i>&gt;        work done by amphibian biologists. They laid out the basic biological road map for the study of regeneration."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Dr. Heber-Katz's discovery of the healer mouse occurred five years ago, when her laboratory was using different</i><br>
<i>&gt;        autoimmune mouse models to study multiple sclerosis. As a way of painlessly and permanently separating one group of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        immunized mice from the others, Dr. Heber-Katz's staff pierced their ears, a standard laboratory method for identifying</i><br>
<i>&gt;        groups. Within weeks, however, the holes had closed. The researchers, thinking they had made a mistake, re-pierced their</i><br>
<i>&gt;        ears. Again, the holes closed with full replacement of the epidermis, dermis and cartilage, and with no evidence of scarring.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "At first" explains Dr. Heber-Katz, "it wasn't clear if we had a model for studying wound repair or regeneration, which is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;        rare form of wound healing in mammals. Since then, however, our findings have made it clear that this is classic epimorphic</i><br>
<i>&gt;        regeneration. These mice have characteristics, including tail regrowth and rapid liver regeneration, similar to those seen in</i><br>
<i>&gt;        amphibian tissue regeneration."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        By crossing mice that are healers with those that are not, Dr. Heber-Katz and her research team are collecting valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt;        information about the genes involved in regeneration. Thus far, they have identified seven chromosomal regions and isolated</i><br>
<i>&gt;        several gene products that differ between healers and non-healers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        They also have found that, as the healer mice age, they do not regenerate as quickly or as well. Yet, when the researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt;        use a specific antibody to deplete a subset of T-cells, which are the cells responsible for cell-mediated immunity, the mice</i><br>
<i>&gt;        heal perfectly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        "It is intriguing to speculate," says Dr. Heber-Katz, "that repair of wounds became dominant in mammals with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;        development of a complex immune system, which was there to protect against tumors. It is known that molecules expressed</i><br>
<i>&gt;        in regenerating tissue are also expressed in tumors and, for that matter, during mammalian development. In fact, fetal wound</i><br>
<i>&gt;        healing is scarless and occurs before the development of the T-cell compartment of the immune system."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Dr. Heber-Katz expects her findings may ultimately make it possible to promote organ replacement, enhance the healing of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        chronic wounds, burns and spinal cord injuries, and control tissue growth. Her work is being funded in part by the National</i><br>
<i>&gt;        Institutes of Health.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        The Wistar Institute, established in 1892, was the first independent medical research facility in the United States. For more</i><br>
<i>&gt;        than 100 years, Wistar scientists have been making history and improving world health through their development of</i><br>
<i>&gt;        vaccines against diseases that include rabies, German measles, infantile gastroenteritis (rotavirus), and cytomegalovirus;</i><br>
<i>&gt;        discovery of molecules like interleukin-12, which are helping the immune system fight bacteria, parasites, viruses and</i><br>
<i>&gt;        cancer; and location of genes that contribute to the development of diseases like breast, lung and prostate cancer. Wistar is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;        National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.</i><br>
