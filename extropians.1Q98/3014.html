<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Memes are usually but not necessarily transmitted</i><br>

<i>&gt;all information has some _indirect_ behavioral</i><br>
<i>&gt;implications.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have I missed anything important here?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
The following is from<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie/meme.htm#faq">http://www.brodietech.com/rbrodie/meme.htm#faq</a>&gt;:<br>
<p>
"Memes are the basic building blocks of our<br>
minds and culture, in the same way that genes<br>
are the basic building blocks of biological life."<br>
<p>
"The breakthrough in memetics is in extending<br>
Darwinian evolution to culture. There are several<br>
exciting conclusions from doing that, one of which<br>
is the ability to predict that ideas will spread<br>
not because they are "good ideas," but because they<br>
contain "good memes" such as danger, food and sex<br>
that push our evolutionary buttons and force us to<br>
pay attention to them."<br>
<p>
We are probably born with many memes relating to<br>
survival and propagation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let me see if I can clarify my notion of "pemes."</i><br>
<i>&gt;As I understand it, the term "peme" is a term coined</i><br>
<i>&gt;as a useful convenience in differentiating so-called</i><br>
<i>&gt;"political memes," ("I must obey the 'authorities,'"</i><br>
<i>&gt;"It's for the good of 'society,", "We must protect</i><br>
<i>&gt;the children," etc.) from memes in general. Pemes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the context of this discussion at least, seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be seen as having the purpose of facilitating the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"political means" to wealth, that is, conning,</i><br>
<i>&gt;extorting, or stealing (rather than negotiating and</i><br>
<i>&gt;trading) value from the people living in a particular</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrarily defined geographical area, and also of</i><br>
<i>&gt;satisfying the genetic inclinations of those with</i><br>
<i>&gt;[coercive] hierarchical tendencies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That is, in this discussion one of the things we</i><br>
<i>&gt;are (or should be) attempting to do is expose and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;identify as many "memes" as possible that probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;have direct behavioral implications, are widely</i><br>
<i>&gt;transmitted, usually but not always verbal in nature,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and have the effect of manipulating people infected</i><br>
<i>&gt;by them to support the local "territorial mafia." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have I missed anything important here?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Surface pemes like "I must obey the 'authorities'"<br>
are relatively weak, relatively easy to spot, and<br>
relatively easy to invalidate and dislodge.  The<br>
"man in the street" clings to surface pemes.  Most<br>
Egoists, Libertarians, Extropians, Objectivists,<br>
Anarchists, etc. have little difficulty dislodging<br>
surcace pemes.<br>
<p>
Deep pemes are vastly more powerful.  For most<br>
people, they are vastly more difficult to spot,<br>
invalidate, and dislodge -- virtually impossible.<br>
For most Egoists, Libertarians, Extropians,<br>
Objectivists, Anarchists, etc., deep pemes are<br>
extremely difficult to spot, invalidate, and<br>
dislodge.  From the time that I identified my first<br>
deep peme in 1977, it took seven years to clear out<br>
all the deep pemes I've found so far.  I haven't<br>
found any new ones since 1984.  For an example of<br>
someone who almost instantly cleared out all his deep<br>
pemes, see &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07e.htm</a>&gt;.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If indeed memes are largely transmitted verbally,</i><br>
<i>&gt;we should attempt to approximate the verbal</i><br>
<i>&gt;content -- even if non-verbal, the equivalent</i><br>
<i>&gt;verbal content would be useful.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
No!  Most people, including practically all Egoists,<br>
Libertarians, Extropians, Objectivists, Anarchists,<br>
etc., will run a mile if you confront them with any<br>
one deep peme.<br>
<p>
They need to be presented very carefully, one at a<br>
time.  Remember the Peme Rules:<br>
<p>
"9. Under no circumstances shall any human be<br>
allowed to question, attack, or expose any deep<br>
pemes.<br>
<p>
10. Any humans who have cleared a few surface<br>
pemes from their brains shall deceive themselves<br>
into believing that they've cleared all pemes<br>
from their brains and that they're "politically<br>
enlightened."<br>
<p>
11. Any humans who attempt to clear any deep<br>
pemes from their brains shall experience a<br>
strong and compelling inner voice telling them,<br>
"I've got to stop this or I'll go crazy!"<br>
<p>
12. Any human who attempts to question, attack,<br>
or expose any deep peme shall be ignored,<br>
ridiculed, or vilified by other humans."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A note about non-verbal pemes: THEY CAN BE</i><br>
<i>&gt;EXTREMELY POWERFUL! Saluting der Fuhrer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the flag, etc. are examples.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To the extent we can expose/identify and</i><br>
<i>&gt;de-bunk such pemes, we may free ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt;and others from their effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One thing that makes the goverment situation</i><br>
<i>&gt;so intractable, I believe, is that it is a jumble</i><br>
<i>&gt;of intertwined "pemes," which, on their own would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be relatively weak, but they are combined with:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Threats of force, violence, and ultimately,</i><br>
<i>&gt;pain, -- and</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Appeals to our underlying small-group</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetically specified instinctive tendancies</i><br>
<i>&gt;(soldiers don't die or sacrifice themselves for</i><br>
<i>&gt;their "governments," they do it for their kids</i><br>
<i>&gt;and families at home and they do it to protect</i><br>
<i>&gt;their immediate buddies). </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is my suggestion that it is this complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;which combines pemes, threats of pain, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;connections to our genetic tendancies which</i><br>
<i>&gt;makes the "government-peme complex" so pernicious,</i><br>
<i>&gt;sort of like the bio-war cocktail reportedly</i><br>
<i>&gt;developed by the Russians composed of anthrax,</i><br>
<i>&gt;bubonic plague, and smallpox.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
A good analogy!  In my opinion, deep pemes are<br>
vastly more powerful in apparently "controlling"<br>
people than "threats of force, violence, and<br>
ultimately, pain."<br>
<p>
In a way, most people, much of the time,<br>
unknowingly "control" themselves through their<br>
deep pemes in ways harmful to themselves and<br>
beneficial to phobocrats, specifically obeying<br>
Peme Rule 19:<br>
"Whenever pro-freedom humans (secondary peme<br>
purveyors) communicate -- although they may<br>
question, attack, and expose a few surface<br>
pemes -- they shall make a special effort to<br>
use deep pemes in their language -- in order<br>
to maximize peme survival and propagation."<br>
<p>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The strength of a meme is often related to how</i><br>
<i>&gt;well it's hidden -- the Dianetics process of</i><br>
<i>&gt;auditing demonstrates this nicely. Exposing memes</i><br>
<i>&gt;often has a similar effect to Toto pulling back</i><br>
<i>&gt;the curtain and exposing the Wizard of Oz for</i><br>
<i>&gt;what he really is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that in this context:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. "Deep pemes" may merely be pemes that haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt;had their equivalent verbal content recently and</i><br>
<i>&gt;objectively exposed to the infected person and/or,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. haven't had their exposed verbal content suitably</i><br>
<i>&gt;de-bunked.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here's an example of how an identification - debunk </i><br>
<i>&gt;equence might work:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Clinton or some other piece of government-clique</i><br>
<i>&gt;fertilizer claims they're doing something for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;children. You ask a "patient" infected with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"government helps/protects, etc. the kids" peme,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"So you believe you should support 'the government'</i><br>
<i>&gt;because they do good things for the kids? Is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;right?" Assuming they agree with this verbalization</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the peme, you then proceed to the debunking phase.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You say something like, "Hmm. That's interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I used to believe that myself. But if 'the government'</i><br>
<i>&gt;really helps the kids, how do you explain these things?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
&lt;List of "bad conditions" snipped&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now sometimes you will put the "patient" into denial.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But as I learned while teaching (we all have our </i><br>
<i>&gt;keletons), there's often a long-term effect. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;above "innoculation," if proprely administered, will</i><br>
<i>&gt;produce the "maybe government doesn't help the kids"</i><br>
<i>&gt;anti-body meme, which will prophilactically cause</i><br>
<i>&gt;the bearer to gather supporting evidence hirself,</i><br>
<i>&gt;often leading to spontaneous recovery from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"governments help the kids" peme in a few weeks,</i><br>
<i>&gt;months or years. Don't expect to see immediate</i><br>
<i>&gt;results however, although sometimes there *are*</i><br>
<i>&gt;"miracle" cures. And remember, you've only treated</i><br>
<i>&gt;one of the many "pemes" this patient probably</i><br>
suffers from.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<p>
The above reflects how a libertrian might go about<br>
helping "the man in the street" clear out some<br>
surface pemes.  No deep pemes are addressed above.<br>
Actually, deep pemes "hide in plain sight," but<br>
most are blind to them and the consequences of<br>
using them.<br>

<i>&gt;would be to identify all the pemes and to discover</i><br>
<i>&gt;how people can clear them from their brains.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe you could make a list of all the pemes</i><br>
<i>&gt;you've either cleared from your brain, or were</i><br>
<i>&gt;never infected by in the first place.]</i><br>
<p>
I'm still waiting for a response from Yak Wax<br>
&lt;yakwax@yahoo.com&gt;.  It's, off course, possible<br>
that he's a deep anarchist and that this entire<br>
debate is for him such a bore that it's not worth<br>
spending any more time on.  (A deep anarchist has<br>
cleared out all or most of his or her deep pemes<br>
and is not subject to the Peme Rules.)<br>
<p>
Earlier definitions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Pemes are political memes.  They consist of ideas, concepts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;phrases, and terms, the use of which increases the power of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "masters" who operate coercive political systems; while</i><br>
<i>&gt;their use reduces the power of the "subjects" of coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt;political systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are surface pemes and deep pemes.  Surface pemes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;relatively easy to identify and invalidate.  An example of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a surface peme is "mandate from the people."  This is used</i><br>
<i>&gt;by politicians and bureaucrats to "justify" their coercive</i><br>
<i>&gt;actions.  It increases their power.  "Subjects" who accept</i><br>
<i>&gt;the "mandate from the people" peme, effectively reduce their</i><br>
<i>&gt;own power because they "authorize" politicians and bureaucrats</i><br>
<i>&gt;to take coercive actions against "subjects."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Deep pemes are much more difficult to identify as such and</i><br>
<i>&gt;to invalidate.  Deep pemes are generally accepted as valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;by practically all people, including freedom lovers.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt;try to question, attack, or invalidate a deep peme, most</i><br>
<i>&gt;people will think you're crazy.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Two questions may help us identify pemes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(1) Which words/concepts -- if I accept and use</i><br>
<i>&gt;them the way most people habitually do -- place</i><br>
<i>&gt;me at a disadvantage in relation to the political</i><br>
<i>&gt;"masters?"  (Which words tend to increase the power</i><br>
<i>&gt;of politicians and bureaucrats, while reducing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;power of their victims?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(2) Which words, if the political "masters" didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;have them nor any equivalents for them, would</i><br>
<i>&gt;dramatically reduce the power of politicians and</i><br>
<i>&gt;bureaucrats?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
If the "typical" Egoist, Libertarian, Extropian,<br>
Objectivist, Anarchist, etc. is asked to make a<br>
list of items that satisfies the above, he or<br>
she will probably come up with a number of surface<br>
pemes, but not one single deep peme.<br>
<p>
A deep anarchist needs a special process for<br>
helping someone shed his or her deep pemes.<br>
There's a little obstacle to overcome: Peme<br>
Rule 9: "Under no circumstances shall any human<br>
be allowed to question, attack, or expose any<br>
deep pemes."<br>
<p>
Around 1981 I had dinner with a close "near-libertarian"<br>
friend in the Atomium restaurant in Brussels.  I tried<br>
an experiment.  Every time he used a deep peme, I<br>
relentlessly challenged it: "What do you mean by<br>
[deep peme]?"; "What are you talking about when you<br>
say [deep peme]?"  After about 20 minutes he became<br>
quite ill, had to go to the bathroom, and puked his<br>
guts out.  He returned to the table after about five<br>
minutes, but couldn't continue his gourmet meal.<br>
Our friendship ceased that night and I haven't seen<br>
him since.<br>
<p>
Deep pemes need to be carefully and gingerly presented<br>
one at a time.<br>
