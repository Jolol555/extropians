<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;It actually goes a bit further than this. In 1996, somebody or other</i><br>
<i>&gt;who nobody had ever heard of took out a trademark on Linux(TM), then wrote</i><br>
<i>&gt;to various companies (SSC and Yggdrasil spring to mind) who make their</i><br>
<i>&gt;living selling Linux books, distributions, or software demanding a pay-</i><br>
<i>&gt;off for use of the name.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With the approval of Linus Torvalds, and a pro bono attorney, SSC,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yggdrasil, Red Hat, and most of the other companies making money out </i><br>
<i>&gt;of Linux started a lawsuit against the parasite, and tried to get</i><br>
<i>&gt;the trademark invalidated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The outcome was that before the case came to court the opportunist</i><br>
<i>&gt;folded, and the trademark was assigned (by mutual consent) to Linus</i><br>
<i>&gt;Torvalds (who (a) invented Linux, and therefore deserves to hold it</i><br>
<i>&gt;if anyone does, and (b) who has no intention of using it to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;money).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is an interesting case insofar as it shows commercial entities</i><br>
<i>&gt;_defending_ a common good (free access to the name "Linux"). The Linux</i><br>
<i>&gt;industry, foetal though it might be at present, seems to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;accomodated itself to the "bazaar" model of software development just</i><br>
<i>&gt;when the rest of the computer industry is at the opposite extreme.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Moreover, those companies -- even the most aggressively corporate</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones, like Caldera -- are putting back freeware into the communal</i><br>
<i>&gt;pot (RedHat's RPM system, Caldera's COAS and PPP code). They're treating</i><br>
<i>&gt;their field as a positive-sum game, where cooperation results in greater</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth than defection and it therefore pays dividends to give software</i><br>
<i>&gt;away for free -- because, of course, the more Good Stuff there is in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the free Linux systems, the more people will use it, and the more</i><br>
<i>&gt;the businesses employing them will be inclined to pay for the commercial </i><br>
<i>&gt;support packages aimed at businesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Seems to me you've proved my point.  The parasite couldn't parasitise<br>
because there is a functioning system of private property rights, and<br>
people were willing to defend the *real* ownership of Linux, which I<br>
think was also Warrl's point.  <br>
<p>
The fact that the real owners and creators have chosen to make their<br>
product freely available is not so important.  The fact of ownership is,<br>
and that is the foundation of a capitalist system. Markets and money are<br>
just one way (the most efficient way for people who are strangers and<br>
not-necessarily-enthusiasts!) of doing economic exchanges. (But granted<br>
pro-capitalists sometimes blur the distinction between the system of<br>
private property rights and the system of market exchange.)<br>
