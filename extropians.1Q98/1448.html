DOUG.BAILEY@ey.com, still suffering from postus interruptus, writes:<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am uncertain about the ancient origins of heroism, but analyzing heroism from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a memetic perspective could prove fruitful.  Heroism generally is respected</i><br>
<i>&gt; most when it involves persona</i><br>
<p>
Here is something I posted last Aug 13 about memetic propagation of<br>
things like heroism:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On Nova last night, I watched Edward O. Wilson rave about the marvelous</i><br>
<i>&gt; success of ants.  These are social insects, which work cooperatively and</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been very effective in their ecological niche.  They have changed</i><br>
<i>&gt; very little over millions of years due to their success, and in many cases</i><br>
<i>&gt; they dominate the ecology at their scale.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The reason cooperation can work despite the competitive pressure of</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution is because all the ants are siblings, children of the same queen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A gene which encourages cooperation, even when it means sacrificing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; favor of the sisters, may cause its host ant to die, but save multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt; copies of itself in the siblings.  So such genes can spread and thrive.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When we look ahead to an era where people can have complete control over</i><br>
<i>&gt; their reproduction, the question is whether a similar phenomenon could</i><br>
<i>&gt; occur.  It makes more sense to look at memes (self-reproducing ideas and</i><br>
<i>&gt; customs).  In terms of memetic reproduction, a meme for cooperation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-sacrifice could succeed if it sufficiently increased its own spread.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The loss of a host would eliminate that host as a vector for future spread</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the meme.  This could still be beneficial for the meme, in a couple of</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances.  The host's sacrifice could increase the survival of other</i><br>
<i>&gt; hosts of the same meme.  This would be directly analogous to the genes</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the ants.  In this case, we'd expect to see a meme for cooperation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but only with other people who shared the same meme.  This could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like a religion which preached kindness to other people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; share the faith, but not to outsiders.  Other social organizations like</i><br>
<i>&gt; clubs or even racial groups could work the same way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another way that a meme could benefit from its host's sacrifice would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; if that event led to an explosive spread of the meme, like a plant which</i><br>
<i>&gt; casts its seeds to the winds even as it dies.  This might apply to a meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; for heroic sacrifice in circumstances where stories would be told about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the host's death.</i><br>
<p>
I might add though that a similar effect is involved in the spread of the<br>
memes for serial killing and for suicidal terrorism.  The meme causes<br>
an act whose notoriety spreads the meme widely.  It then only needs to<br>
take root in a few individuals to survive.<br>
<p>
Of course, heroes are praised, while serial killers are condemned.  So<br>
there is more involved than just this simple memetic competition.  But<br>
the cases do share some similarities in how the memes spread.<br>
<p>
