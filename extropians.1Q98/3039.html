<p>
You realize that your suggestion, while functional, would break other<br>
e-mail situations, and corrects a problem that only this List has?  Yes I<br>
do have my mail set to reply to all participants.  If I get mail "From:<br>
Person A", "To: Person B", "CC: Person C", and "Reply-To: Person D", I<br>
really do want my comments to go back to all of them.  If I start excluding<br>
specific headers from getting a reply, then I will start dropping<br>
participants in other multi-person e-mail conversations.  Therefore, my<br>
default setting is as you describe, and I do my best to remember to<br>
manually edit my replies to this list to remove the "bad" address and keep<br>
only the "good" address.<br>
<p>
I purposefully let the default headers from the List go uncorrected in this<br>
case, so that anybody who checked the headers would see that my description<br>
of the List process was correct.  I sent my e-mail to one address only.<br>
The List itself added the second address.  Depending on your software<br>
settings, you might have duplicated your response to me.  My method of<br>
posting is valid and nonduplicating.  My method of replying is valid and<br>
nonduplicating.  It is only when these two methods are also combined with<br>
the List's added headers and duplicate naming, that we will see duplicate<br>
posts.  Although we can break this chain of events on the sending side or<br>
the receiving side, as network engineer I would  blame the List Software<br>
itself as being the root cause of the problem.<br>
<p>
If there is no good reason to run this List under two different alias<br>
names, the problem can be easily solved once and for all.  My question is<br>
"Who configures this List?", and "Why is it set up to do this?"  Is there<br>
really a good reason that the List sends out headers with two different<br>
names for itself?  If we edited everything down to use just one and only<br>
one name, wouldn't that be more straightforward and work better?<br>
