When Dolly arrived, the trouble started. Ongoing and noisy debates in all<br>
major mass media on a very low level -- especially, as always, in the yellow<br>
press -- have indeed shown that most opposers of a free policy of cloning<br>
argue on an irrational basis, oftenly caused by religous belief. With Mr.<br>
Seed's recent statements, the debate got heated up once again.<br>
<p>
I've written up an article about the Dangers of Cloning last year<br>
(<a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/Problems_of_Cloning_and_Possible_Solutions/clone.htm">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/Problems_of_Cloning_and_Possible_Solutions/clone.htm</a>).<br>
Now it seems like what I stated there might indeed become reality.<br>
<p>
Mr. Seed said that he will reduce the "cost of a clone". Note: He didn't say<br>
that he will reduce the cost of cloning. This is a further advance which makes<br>
a human a product which you can either afford or not, depending on your<br>
position in the capitalist society. Of course this is perfectly in the line of<br>
thinking of a free market capitalist. In his view, humans have always been<br>
products, and this is also true even today. We prostitute ourselves when we<br>
offer our services for money, making us loan-slaves. If we don't agree with a<br>
society of loan-slavery, we must either depend on charity (provided by the<br>
state or local organizations in an always decreasing level) or starve. <br>
<p>
OK, that's reality today. The human clone is just an expansion of this idea.<br>
And in the discussion on this list, the expression "to have the child you<br>
want" was already formed. Of course Extropians are always a little faster than<br>
the rest of the capitalist society, but I guess finally it will go this way.<br>
<p>
To have the child you want. Note: Not "to have a child if you want it". That's<br>
a right and desire I perfectly understand. But "having the child you want" - a<br>
phrase used by Chris Hibbert without deeper consideration of its meaning - is<br>
impossible with cloning. <br>
<p>
The reason is apparent: The clone will only biologically meet with the buyer's<br>
ideas. And here's where the problems start.<br>
<p>
First, as we've already determined that humans and clones are just products<br>
available on the free market, let's consider the consequences. The products we<br>
buy when our most urgent needs are satisfied (which is a luxuary not everyone<br>
on our small planet can afford, thanks to this incredibe free market) depend<br>
on the information we have consumed. As this information is mainly created and<br>
spread by TV nowadays, most humans are quite uneducated. Trends and fashions<br>
are created through marketing. What's cool today is a bunch of shit tomorrow.<br>
<p>
And a human is just a product.<br>
<p>
Which means, of course, that the clone we've bought might be a nice toy today,<br>
especially if it's made of DNA of a famous personality. But it might get<br>
boring tomorrow and be disposed. You'd buy a clone not because you want a<br>
child, but because you want a toy. And who keeps his modern teddy bear<br>
forever? Who cares for it when you don't want it anymore? Would you send your<br>
teddy bear to a school? No? So what does the clone do when he has grown up and<br>
nobody wants him anymore?<br>
<p>
Also, history has shown what humans can do to other humans when they're given<br>
the right to do whatever they want to do to them. For example, at times war.<br>
In WW II, a brothel was created for female Jews who were later (after being<br>
used, as the products they had become) disposed in the gas chambers. Ah, I<br>
guess we'll find some fellows who doubt this on this funny little mailing<br>
list, too. After all, you seriously discuss "child rearing" and the right for<br>
the possession of guns here. <br>
<p>
Back to the present. The main problem with free cloning is what I've described<br>
as "Funcloning" in my article. Clones as products/toys for a privileged (for<br>
biological cloning will always be expensive) minority seem much more likely<br>
than clones as a good means of reproduction for infertile humans or homosexual<br>
pairs. In addition, even clones used in deadly gameshows are imaginable. Or in<br>
a human zoo.<br>
<p>
Already today, humans are enslaved in American prisons to provide services.<br>
These prisons are getting a major competitor on the free market. And what do<br>
you do when you need more workers? You recruit them, by spreading a little<br>
crack or selling a few weapons and having the police already at hand when it<br>
gets interesting. A prison state is not just a dark fantasy anymore, some<br>
already *call* America a prison state.<br>
<p>
Eugene Leitl, you have described what I call Funcloning as "neoluddism".<br>
Another fancy keyword. But who's the one who has fun here? Progess is fine.<br>
Cloning is OK if it is used by those who need it. But humans must not be made<br>
more product-like than they already are. <br>
Otherwise your beloved singularity will remain a wet dream for your lifetime.<br>
