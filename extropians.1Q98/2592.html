<p>
Your articles are memetic... and they're certainly political...  but<br>
somehow you seem to think that you're clearing away pemes rather than<br>
replacing them with your own.<br>
<p>
Your meme, which happens to be political, has several traits which make it<br>
fairly adaptable.  It appeals to other deep memes, notably freedom (in this<br>
case, from pemes), self-ownership, and levels of development.  It<br>
circumvents serious criticism with Peme Rule 12:  "Any human who attempts<br>
to question, attack, or expose any deep peme shall be ignored, ridiculed,<br>
or vilified by other humans."  It emphasizes the malicious nature of pemes,<br>
thus harnessing the very deep meme of self-preservation.<br>
<p>
Consider this:  if you were to erase all political memes from your mind<br>
tomorrow, you would have no political opinion, because you would have no<br>
ideas about politics.  No freedom thoughts, no authoritarian thoughts, no<br>
thoughts at all about government and/or its value to society (if any).<br>
That's what it means to have no memes:  you have no ideas.<br>
<p>
Freedom is a peme, too, ya know.  It's especially adaptable because its<br>
meaning is so ambiguous, yet it seems to appeal to everyone.  We get<br>
freedom of speech, freedom of choice, freedom from choice, peme-freedom,<br>
meme-freedom, free-markets, economic freedom (a term sadly appropriated by<br>
communists), degrees of freedom, and free energy...  all from the same word.<br>
<p>
So I put it to you again:  you're selling a meme, and it's political.  I<br>
conclude that you're selling me a peme.  You're not crazy... or even wrong,<br>
per se.  But you aren't eliminating pemes...  you're just replacing them<br>
with deeper ones which aren't open to criticism.<br>
<p>
(If you now go on to tell me that I operate at peme freedom level 1, you<br>
will have missed the point of this post.)<br>
