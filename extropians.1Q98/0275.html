<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Sounds unlikely, but what is the evidence for your theory?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My first evidence is that our ancestrals did not age (bacteria don't age</i><br>
<i>&gt; and most of the non-aging species are quite primitive in an evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; scale). If aging "evolved", it can be caused by two types of errors: (1)</i><br>
<i>&gt; old processes that started to fail; or (2) new processes that are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; perfect yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; About the evolution of aging species towards non-aging species, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; question might be asked of weather these species suppressed aging or</i><br>
<i>&gt; their evolutionary "relatives" in more hazardous positions evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt; aging? I think it can go either way, the best evidence I have supporting</i><br>
<i>&gt; the first option is that there is some evolutionary pressure against</i><br>
<i>&gt; aging in species who live non-hazardous lives. For example, in mammals,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the species with the longest life span (ours), is the one with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; longest maturation time, something that can only be achieved by being on</i><br>
<i>&gt; top of the food chain.</i><br>
<p>
Well, if we are to first assume that to prevent aging means to encourage<br>
constant cell growth, then we run into a bit of an engineering problem.<br>
At our current size and growth rates, the average human, if it kept<br>
growing would eventually reach heights and girths that would push the<br>
structural limitations of the human skeleton, as well as push the<br>
hydrodynamic tolerances of the cardiovascular and lymphic systems, i.e.<br>
we'd develop bone disorders (as many giants do) as well as increased<br>
risk of heart failure. To counter this, we can either a) move out of a 1<br>
g gravity field, to the moon or Mars, etc. or b) genetically engineer<br>
ourselves to grow slower from the get go, and/or improve the structural<br>
and hydrodynamic capabilities of the human body.<br>
<p>
I think that the real question to ask is why simple organisms can keep<br>
on dividing and reproducing without any serious genetic drift or loss of<br>
chromosomal integrity, as we experience with our shortening telomeres,<br>
and what can we do to maintain youthful or at least positive sum cell<br>
division rates for as long as possible. Budding, anybody? Perhaps for<br>
real immortality, we will need to genetically engineer ourselves to bud<br>
off clones of ourselves as a natural process, with some sort of organ<br>
that uses indictive or capacitive signals to pass data through the skin<br>
for a sort of mind meld capability.<br>
