<i>&gt; From:          Ian Goddard &lt;igoddard@erols.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why are Bill and/or Hillary obligated to tell us the truth </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; about their private sexual lives? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  IAN: I agree that they are not so obliged. It seems </i><br>
<i>&gt;  to me that lies about private and consensual sexual </i><br>
<i>&gt;  activity do not fall into the category of unethical, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  since private means "off limits" by definition, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;  therefore this whole affair should be off limits to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  both the press and Starr. People going into public </i><br>
<i>&gt;  life have to sacrifice many areas of their private </i><br>
<i>&gt;  lives, but their sexual activity, so long as it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;  consensual, is and should not be one of those areas. </i><br>
<p>
There is the question of whether all the sexual activity is <br>
consensual, or whether some of it constitutes abuse of authority -- <br>
with the proviso that if one of these ladies *wanted* to have sex <br>
with the President, that wasn't Clinton's fault; what I am concerned <br>
about is the potential for suggestions (ranging from extremely vague <br>
hints to blatant declarations), coming directly or indirectly from <br>
Clinton, that sex would be rewarded or refusal punished.<br>
<p>
I would point out that exactly the same concerns arise in regard to <br>
lying about sex, though.  And it is moderately well established that <br>
Clinton himself *did* instruct, in an employer-to-subordinate mode, <br>
one of his staffers to lie about certain meetings with one of his <br>
alleged mistresses.  That is enough in my mind to establish abuse of <br>
authority.<br>
<p>
And for that matter, "None of your business" would have won Clinton a <br>
*lot* of sympathy *without* being a lie.  Clinton chose an <br>
unconvincing lie over a convincing truth.  On his head be the <br>
consequences.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, in spite of all that, I find myself compelled to <br>
support him and hope he survives the scandal -- for as long as Gore <br>
is next in line.<br>
