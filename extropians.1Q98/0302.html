<i>&gt; &gt; I wasn't saying "Justice is Revenge" because I think revenge is a</i><br>

is<br>

<p>
True.  But I've yet to hear any description of justice that doesn't<br>
qualify as revenge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I find nothing wrong with people cooperating to rid themselves of a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; common threat (in which ever way they see fit.)  But the justice</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; system goes beyond that, and creates a fixed set of threats which</i><br>
are<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; apparently (whether you like it or not) for your own good.  And I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would argue that all "punishments" are revenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any judgement that does not a) provide proportionate compensation to</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; victims, and b) rehabilitate those that are capable of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; rehabilitated, while eradicating those who are not from the gene pool,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not justice.</i><br>
<p>
Two things:  Proportionate compensation doesn't have to involve the<br>
criminal.  If I need to defend myself from someone then rehabilitation<br>
is an option (although a difficult one.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana</i><br>
back.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Unless there's plenty of other banana's around, in which case taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; my banana is vengeful.  Otherwise I agree that you should satisfy</i><br>
your<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; banana needs.  But I don't see why we need to call that justice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; it is reestablishing the stasis in existence prior to the use of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unjustified force.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A justified force in equal opposition reestablishes the prior state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Justice.</i><br>
<p>
Revenge.  You're using force against someone who you consider to be<br>
unjust.  You can call it just or unjust all you want but the reason<br>
you want to reestablish prior state is because you thought it was<br>
unfair and you want revenge.  When in fact it is neither fair nor<br>
unfair, it just is!  Besides, reestablishing the prior state isn't at<br>
all extropian!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I take your banana. When I'm not looking you steal the banana</i><br>
back,<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; pour</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; gasoline on me, set me on fire and laugh at my screams of agony</i><br>
as I<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; burn</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; alive and beg for death.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Revenge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; True.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At the same time, if you peacefully ask me for part of my banana,</i><br>
and I<br>
<i>&gt; refuse, that is acting justly within ones rights. If I refused, told</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt; to "go get a job you lousy slacker, you aren't worth a pot of piss,</i><br>
etc<br>
<i>&gt; etc etc" and called a cop on you for being a vagrant panhandler,</i><br>
<i>&gt; loitering and harassing pedestrians, that would be another thing</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely..</i><br>
