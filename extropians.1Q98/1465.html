Or for that matter, why not have a NCT to motivate the lower income people<br>
to better their incomes?  This "tax the rich" meme is destructive to the<br>
lower economic classes in the long run.  More than half of the current<br>
millionaires in the US are blue collar workers who busted their ass and<br>
invested wisely.  If you look at the profile of the average millionaire in<br>
the US (Money magazine did such a detailed survey last year), you will find<br>
that most of them are indistinguishable (lifestyle-wise and<br>
background-wise) from the average American.<br>
<p>
I am one of those people who makes more than $100k, but I worked and<br>
invested to make every penny.  I should not be penalized because I make<br>
more than the next guy; odds are I work harder and longer than the next guy<br>
to make my money.  Nonetheless, I pay more than half of my income in taxes<br>
already, to support a system that was unwilling to help me when I made<br>
nothing (yes, I am a single white male).  For most of my life, I have lived<br>
in poverty by any American standard (i.e. didn't have a TV for most of my<br>
childhood, and sometimes no food either).  <br>
<p>
<p>
It doesn't disturb me that I was unable to get aid from the goverment when<br>
I needed it.  What *does* disturb me is that they expect me to pay for<br>
everyone else now that I make decent living by my own efforts.  This is<br>
terribly inequitable and gives me nothing but the deepest revulsion for<br>
government and the taxes they impose.  It is government of the parasites,<br>
by the parasites, for the parasites.  I would rather opt out, thank you<br>
very much.<br>
