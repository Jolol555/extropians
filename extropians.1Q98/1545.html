I'm not sure what you mean by a "lookup table", but almost any  meaning<br>
that makes sense would be a turing machine. So, you appear to believe<br>
that "strong AI" is equivalent to saying that a intelligence is turing<br>
computable,<br>
and that you don't agree? What needs to be added? would continuous<br>
analog elements of some sort suffice, or do you need quantum effects?<br>
<p>
I don't have a strong opinion on this, but don't think it much matters<br>
as its trivial to incorporate either analog or quantum elements in<br>
any actual physical system, so the need for such elements will not<br>
hinder the advent of an SI. In particular, the digital elements can<br>
interact with humans, with the humans providing the necessary non-<br>
turing portion of the intelligence.<br>
