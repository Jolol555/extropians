<p>
I may be in error, but I certainly intend no fraud.  Look, my impression<br>
is that while nonhuman animals cannot compose a sonnet on the subject of<br>
their suffering, they manage to communicate pain and distress quite<br>
compellingly.  One of the reasons that the industrial "processing" of<br>
animal bodies into "food" takes place behind such insistently closed<br>
doors.  From the point of view of a Power, it may well be that the noises<br>
we make on the subject of, say, "the weather" do not qualify us as<br>
sentient either.  <br>

<i>&gt; humans I've met who are dumber than a side of beef). Since your typical vegan</i><br>

<i>&gt; claim the protections of the Natural Law doctrine, so they must then agree</i><br>

<i>&gt; individuals who are willing to use force, or employ others to use force, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; attain and protect those rights for themselves, i.e. the Force Doctrine.</i><br>
<p>
Rights culture seems to me to be a spontaneous order which emerged over<br>
history to secure better societies than existed under other ways of doing<br>
justice. I see them underwritten by traditions, or fuzzy consensus more<br>
like, rather than God or nature or foundations or what have you.  The leap<br>
from this to your force doctrine seems suspiciously wide to me.  I can<br>
easily imagine a rights culture held together by little more than the<br>
sense that inflicting pain unecessarily is a bad thing.  As I said before,<br>
I don't know how coherent it is to demand that we extend formal "rights" <br>
to nonhuman animals, but I am quite convinced that there should be<br>
*ethical* injunctions against treating animals like objects.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I dunno. Given the possibilities for the singularity, I would daresay that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; large percentage of the human race will soom become a literal evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; dead end. WOuld they prefer a quick end, or to live on as the pawns and</i><br>
<i>&gt; playthings of greater beings?</i><br>
<p>
I have a stake in a future politics that tries to ensure that the pawns<br>
have a voice in that particular decision.  I am not quite as confident as<br>
you seem to be about judging everyday people or nonhuman animals as<br>
dispensible.  Oh, and since all this really is veering quickly away from the proper<br>
extropian purview, how about this:<br>
1. Vegetarianism is extropian because it is a healthy lifestyle.<br>
2. Vegetarianism is extropian because it broadens and complicates our<br>
ethical perception of the world.<br>
3. Vegetarianism is extropian because it is an ethical laboratory in which<br>
we can think about proper political and ethical relations between<br>
radically different kinds of beings *before* a singularity-like-event<br>
forces us to do so.<br>
