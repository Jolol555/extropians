You've overstated the number by a factor of 2. It's only about 20K actually<br>
(still a heck of a lot). [btw, The "Organized Crime" page<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.crime.org/">http://www.crime.org/</a>&gt;<br>
is a great site to quickly gather info on this kind of stuff.]<br>

<i>&gt;unable to prove I didn't commit.</i><br>
<p>
If you can't prove that you weren't present for over 10K violent deaths, you<br>
are definitely up to something. Helloooo, Dr. Kevorkian!<br>

Only in countries with the Napoleonic Code or similar. In England, America,<br>
and<br>
the other Common Law nations, we hold to the "innocent until proven guilty"<br>
standard. Although the system may be abused and stressed at times, that<br>
standard is consistently applied. Note that "prove" means different things in<br>
the US depending on whether the act in question is a felony or not. The<br>
standard<br>
of proof that the prosecution has to meet is much higher for felony cases.<br>
