<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; irrespective of the freedom and sovereignty of others?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What if I can discover that I'm free and sovereign by</i><br>

Mr. Mann speak her against his own words: "We have to use our<br>
minds to expand in a way that could snowballs. We could acti-<br>
vate the minds of others into becoming more potent freedom<br>
weapons." Why should we do this if we are really free and so-<br>
vereign *by nature*, irrespective of the freedom and sovereig-<br>
nty of others and if we can live as a free sovereign -- irres-<br>
pective of the unfree masses who haven't yet discovered they're<br>
free and sovereign?! If we can live as free sovereigns without<br>
others -- why to hell should we activate other minds into more<br>
potent freedom weapons?!!<br>
<p>
And on the other hand:<br>
Who is my freedom and sovereignity by nature if I live in a<br>
poor country with 50% unenployment, a high inflation, no industry<br>
and 150 $ annual salary average per inhabitant?! Who is my free-<br>
dom and sovereignity by nature if I am very poor and hungry?!<br>
Who to hell is my freedom and sovereignity by nature if I don't<br>
find solvent customers for my service in a backward country?!<br>
<p>
I didn't say that "freedom is indivisible" -- but we have to accept<br>
that the system isn't only a spiritual phenomenon; it's a fallacy<br>
that the system havn't no negative practical economic effects. To<br>
free humans from 'peme' programs as the only simple way to give<br>
everybody a chance to discover they're free and sovereign is a<br>
midlle class dream in industrial countries. If we should activate<br>
our freedom and sovereignity by nature irrespective of others than<br>
we need a developt economy like the industrial nations and last but<br>
not least a access to the internet -- and this isn't for 80% of<br>
humans on earth a option.<br>
