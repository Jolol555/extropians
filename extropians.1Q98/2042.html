Heinleinian Nests are fun!  <br>
<p>
You might want to check out the "Phoenexus" (play on nexus) of extropian<br>
cryonicists (they number 5 people + 3 cats.)  The are probably the most<br>
clearly cut extropian-type community where people live.  They have wonderful<br>
parties and open their home to friends.  But this is no different, actually<br>
than other extropian orbs, such as "Exorbs" (play on orb) that cluster around.<br>
<p>
I think Max More can give you a synopsis of extropian Heinleinian Nest-type<br>
living arrangements.  He has created several himself, and did live with the<br>
Phoenexus extropians while they were still called the "Nexus" while living<br>
in Riverside, California.  I remember the Nexus parties where filled with<br>
cryonicists and an Heinleinian, or better extropian atmosphere of heightened<br>
value, interest and meaning.<br>
<p>
Other extropian habitats have sprung up over the years.  The exclave --<br>
vis-a-vis extropian Dave Krieger (who was visiting our extropian orb<br>
Saturday evening) -- the exclave is a play on enclave and the dictionary<br>
gives it an island type of meaning, "a part of a country that is isolated<br>
from the main part and is surrounded by foreign territory."  Not quite a<br>
sovereign territory.<br>
<p>
Here are some other extropian plays on Heinleinian-type nests:   Exone<br>
(zone), Exiron (environ) .....<br>
<p>
Yet, extropians have not designed an architectural model for the type of<br>
community being discussed here.  The initial concept of Extropia, as T.O.<br>
Morrow mentioned, is a great lead in and excerpts of it can be introduced in<br>
the conversation.  <br>
<p>
All the nests discussed above are more like mobile living arrangements where<br>
extropians share similar philosophical views and work-habits.  We do not<br>
have a definitive extropian community that actually exists to date.<br>
