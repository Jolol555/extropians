We talk about governmental theory and revolution, but put our hopes in<br>
some rich people saving us all by funding technology that would be good<br>
for us and then making it widely available to everyone. <br>
<p>
If the research is to happen according to the ideas stated in this<br>
list, then the people who believe in that research will need to pool<br>
their resources and invest in it themselves (with enough people, of<br>
course, the individual commitment need not be large). Otherwise, the other<br>
large investors will, as usual, redirect the research towards other ends. <br>
<p>
As a more conventional approach, we should be able to find biotech startup<br>
companies to invest in now. Several have made the news over the past year. <br>
Some should be acceptable to list members. Nothing stops us from<br>
identifying and supporting them now.<br>
