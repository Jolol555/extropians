For the record, 7 justices signed on to the Roe vs. Wade majority<br>
opinion.<br>
<p>
And while it is true that members of the Supreme Court are not elected,<br>
the President who appoints them and the Senators who confirm them are.<br>
<p>
I am sympathetic to the case that this is a matter that should have been<br>
left to the states; but if Roe vs. Wade were ever to be reversed, you do<br>
realize that there is no way you would ever have abortion totally<br>
outlawed in all states. California, for example, would almost certainly<br>
retain very permissive laws.<br>
