Fetus is not people. Even a newborn infant is not a human being, just a<br>
larva bearing the potential to become one. For the record, if there was no<br>
Singularity eugenics would be a singularly great idea. Uravnilovka just<br>
can't dig it. Imnsfho.<br>

Please define free will. It does mean different things to different<br>
people. Just now, it doesn't mean diddlysquat to me.<br>

<p>
Oh, so now it's part of the mother. By the DNA identity it's also part of<br>
the father. Are you allowed to trade the placenta (to cuisinart it into<br>
pate)? By all rights you must reimburse the embryo.<br>
<p>
Maybe we are trying to apply the inapplicable? And inasmuch can laying on<br>
the the legalese too heavy help us heah'? Maybe just speaking legalese<br>
won't help us too much here, after all?<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; I think that just about ends the discussion, don't you?</i><br>

<i>&gt; I think that people who think in that way don't really know the holocaust.  </i><br>
<p>
Have you known 'the Holocaust'? What does it mean to 'know the Holocaust'? <br>
Being one of the gassers? The gassed ones? The onlookers on the street?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They belittle and play down the holocaust; the jews in Nazi germany have  </i><br>

<p>
Theoretical human rights is just what they are: theoretical. If there is<br>
no muscle to enforce them, as well you just can go off to hunt the snark.<br>
Which means, you'd bloody make sure you actually have the muscle.<br>
<p>

A self-defined class of people attempted extermination of a much more<br>
fuzzy (since not only self-defined) class of people. Nothing new, so far. <br>
As the lattermentioned were unable to prevent the abovementioned (well,<br>
they were Untermenschen), the action almost succeeded. Now what do we<br>
learn from that?<br>
