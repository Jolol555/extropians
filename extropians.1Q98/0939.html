<i>&gt;	Why do you think the image of modern technology being 'out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;control' has such a strong appeal? In what ways does technology appear</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficult to control?</i><br>
<p>
Hmm.  From a somewhat oblique angle, I was thinking about something like<br>
this the other day when I wrote a piece for the Melbourne Age (not yet<br>
published) about the purported telomere breakthrough.  The newspaper had<br>
published a snide editorial the day after the announcement, and I wrote in<br>
part:<br>
<p>
===================<br>
<p>
Despite the beautiful patterns of life, evolution *has* no plan.  It is a<br>
gigantic, stupid lottery.  In such a universe, we are freed from fears of<br>
impiety.  Since evolution does not have a plan for us, we may choose one<br>
for ourselves.  In fact, that is what we have always done, whether we knew<br>
it or not.  <br>
<p>
Yet people find it hard to grasp this essential moral point.  The day after<br>
the immensely important Wright-Shay discovery was published, a whimsical<br>
editorial appeared in the Age poking cautionary fun at the `tireless<br>
scientists'.  I suspect the writer implied `tiresome' as well, for these<br>
scientific wretches were pandering, apparently, `to this society's<br>
adoration of youth'.  On the contrary - those benefiting most from<br>
rejuvenation and an extended life span will be the elderly.  It's a grim<br>
threat the editorial missed: rule forever by deathless Baby Boomers!<br>
<p>
The editorial noted that in Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels*, the<br>
immortal Struldbruggs `were the most miserable of mankind'.  Hmm - Dean<br>
Swift himself was a notable grump, a dyspeptic misanthrope who never<br>
recovered from the ghastly shock that his beautiful Celia defecated like<br>
the rest of us.  Such one-sided fables - Frankenstein's hubristic fate is<br>
another, and the Greek legend of Tithonus who lived forever in senility -<br>
always get trotted out as if they prove something, as if they are *reports*<br>
instead of *inventions*.<br>
<p>
Defeating death and planning rejuvenation are no more absurd as goals than<br>
finding remedies for short-sightedness or asthma (I've been on daily<br>
prophylactic drugs for asthma for more than a quarter of a century, and it<br>
has improved my life beyond recognition).  We manage quite well without an<br>
evolved ability to read and write at birth, or to fly a jet by instinct.  <br>
<p>
Ultimately, we might expect to fix what is called `ageing' - the damage and<br>
at last senescence that now accumulates with the passage of time - and find<br>
ways to outwit it.  The human population explosion will become an even more<br>
pressing emergency, but we must solve that in any case.  Perhaps the price<br>
of immortality will be elective or imposed sterilisation.<br>
<p>
Does this also imply a sterile cultural future?  Why should it?  Remaining<br>
young for centuries or millennia is not the same as an eternity of<br>
sclerotic senility.  We will have time to learn all things - time enough,<br>
as the optimistic science fiction writer Robert Heinlein wrote, for love.<br>
<p>
The Age editorial ended, to my disbelief: `Dying (we think) is not all that<br>
bad.'  Frankly, I can't think of anything to be said in its favour.  We're<br>
stuck with death's pain, loss and grief at the moment, and must make as<br>
decent a fist of it as we can.  But in the longest term of the history of<br>
intelligent life in the universe, it will surely be the case - tragic, but<br>
blessedly brief in comparative duration - that the routine and inevitable<br>
death of conscious beings was a temporary error, quickly corrected.<br>
<p>
=========================<br>
<p>
I think the answer to Brad's question lies in the nagging painful questions<br>
writhing between these two positions: the sarcastically defensive editorial<br>
and my somewhat disingenuous rallying-cry (I acknowledge, of course, that<br>
optional immortality will have an *immensely* disruptive impact on all<br>
cultures, and on everyone's deepest sense of self and expectations from life).<br>
