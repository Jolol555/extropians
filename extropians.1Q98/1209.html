The general flaw in any attempt to "explain" mystical or spiritual aspects (in<br>
the general meaning of such terms) is that invariably such discussions involve<br>
"leaps" (of faith, perhaps) where the argument is disjointed.  I find the same<br>
leaps in the various essays contained at the Goddard Metaphysics site.<br>
<p>
The most glaring leap I observed is the "necessity of divinity" as I like to<br>
call it.  It is the assertion that something about the universe "just has to<br>
be"  spiritual or mystical.  This statement is never explained or<br>
rationalized.  The general defense to this lack of rationalization is that such<br>
divine affairs defy our abilities to rationalize them.  If this is the case<br>
then they fit securely in the realm of Agnosticism, the unknowable.  By<br>
"knowable" I mean phenomena of the universe (multiverse) that can be<br>
independently verified by a variety of observers.  To me, it does not make<br>
sense to construct elaborate "proofs" of something that is by its very nature<br>
unprovable.  Furthermore, is it not a paradox to assert that one can use logic<br>
to prove the existence of something that is allegedly transcendental?<br>
<p>
Additional Note on Wiley's "The  Nothing that is Everything"<br>
I do not believe that Wiley's argument successfully proves that infinity equals<br>
zero.  What he has shown is that infinity minus infinity equals zero, which I<br>
believe is an uncontended point.  I am probably reading more meaning into<br>
Wiley's paper than prudence would dictate, but technically the universe is a<br>
zero sum game in that (at least according to theory) there is an equal amount<br>
of positive energy (matter, mc^2, and so forth) and negative energy<br>
(antimatter, gravitational energy, etc.)  What evades me is how the zero sum<br>
aspect of the universe can be construed to prove that something about the<br>
universe is "divine".  In my opinion, Wiley uses lots of mathematics, logic,<br>
and analogies wholly unrelated to his objective (substantiate the claim that<br>
something about the universe is divine) to obfuscate the leaps of faith he<br>
takes in his paper.<br>
