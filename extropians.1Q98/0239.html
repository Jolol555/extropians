From: Arjen Kamphuis &lt;mountain@knoware.nl&gt;<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;last week I was again confronted with the problem of keeping the</i><br>
<i>&gt;inside of my little dome-tent to an agreeable temperature while</i><br>
<i>&gt;there was a blizzard going on outside (temperature someting like</i><br>
<i>&gt;-25 C). I know, it's completely illogical to want to camp at</i><br>
<i>&gt;12.000 feet at newyear but humans do things because they _want_</i><br>
<i>&gt;to, not out of neccesity.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
First, Insulation is the key, having a top quality sleeping bag is<br>
a must, in case of emergency we don't want you going prematurely<br>
cryonic on us.... ;) A good insulation choice would be to carry a<br>
second dome tent slightly larger than the one you intend to stay<br>
in, (1-2" is best) you erect your tent inside the other, you'd be<br>
amazed at how well this works. <br>
<p>
Is there snow available? Build a Quinzee, which is the loose snow<br>
version of an igloo. Just make a big pile of snow with whatever is<br>
available: shovel, snowshow, hubcab, cardboard (were talking<br>
general survival now) be sure to dig a couple of feet down, the<br>
trick to a quinzee is that snow forms layers at different<br>
temps/water content, when you mix it all up in a big pile it will<br>
freeze solid, and can be easily hollowed out. I've built these at<br>
the military cold weather facility at Bridgeport Nev at -60 at<br>
14,000 feet. If your down in the woods, you can stick a couple of<br>
dozen twigs a foot or so long in the snow to act as 1' guides when<br>
you hollow it out. These babies can be kept well above freezing<br>
inside. We forget what a great insulator snow is, it's only fault<br>
is that its an insulator that starts to melt at 0 degrees C.<br>
<p>
Second is to eat properly, no dieting here, calories like crazy...<br>
<p>
Third is to drink enough water, cold fools the body into<br>
dehydration, a liter per 20 kilos body weight per day is needed<br>
(like the metric bit?) just to stay even, more to stay comfortable.<br>
The best thing to do if you feel chilled? Drink water. (no alcohol)<br>
<p>
Okay, Fourth, you mentioned lighting the stove, not bad, but be<br>
sure to be heating something, melting water is best of course since<br>
its one of your most essential needs, even if you have enough<br>
water, heat some more. Check to see if the maker of your stove has<br>
a separate catalytic heating attachment, you'll burn much less<br>
fuel, much lower emissions and get lots more heat.<br>
<p>
When I was a boy-scout, they used to have these really neat pocket<br>
catalytic heaters, the big model was the size of a small paper back<br>
book, you'd state the element, and close the lid (they looked like<br>
big zippo lighters) then drop it into a red flannel pouch and pop<br>
it into your pocket. I don't know if there still made, I've got a<br>
friend who's a scoutmaster checking on it.<br>
<p>
Now, electricity! There are a number of manufacturers making<br>
ruggedizeds (sp?) solar panels, you could put it on the outside of<br>
the backback, and charge while climbing! The beauty of it is that<br>
it would get more efficient the higher you go!<br>
