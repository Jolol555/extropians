Well, from the outside, the way I (and i assume most of the rest of the world) see<br>
it, the US did not "win" world war II or the post-war period, it did what it has<br>
done most of this century, which is wait for the combatants to wear each other out<br>
and then to step in.<br>
<p>
The US entered world war I in 1917 (!), and would undoubtedly have entered world war<br>
2 later on in the piece if the Japanese hadn't seen the writing on the wall and<br>
tried to get in first. The US is more competitive than the French. Sure. the french<br>
have also fought three major wars on their own territory in 100 years, whereas the<br>
US has merely exported such.  This attitude you have is akin to someone stepping in<br>
at the late part of a fight, kicking the victor in the head several times while they<br>
are trying to get off the floor, and then telling everyone how tough they are. No<br>
one believes it. Sure, the US has nukes. The US developed it's nukes with the help<br>
of the rest of the allies, and then used it's undamaged economic base, maintained on<br>
a war footing throughout the 50s to run about and bully the rest of the world.<br>
While I have a lot of friends in the US, and on the whole most of the americans I<br>
have come across are very nice people, this bullshit manifest destiny attitude is<br>
incredibly annoying, and I remind you of what happened to Rome when the empire fell,<br>
and consider the gunboat diplomacy the US has been practising for most of this<br>
century, and the widespread resentment it has engendered.  if the US way of life was<br>
so incredibly superior, why is it that no-one else feels this way? I don't see the<br>
american way of doing things taking over the world. Democracy is not an american<br>
invention, neither is capitalism. What purely american systems have been<br>
successfully exported overseas?<br>
