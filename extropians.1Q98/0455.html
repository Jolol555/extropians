That's amazing - I haven't been keeping up with Wired or any other<br>
magazines recently due to extended work on my book and thesis - but as a<br>
child,  is there anything that I can do to help the Extropian cause in<br>
dealing with this Junior Summit or Nation.1?<br>
<p>
Nation.1 definitely sounds like something I'll have to look into.<br>

<i>&gt; I read just this in a Nicholas Negroponte's recent Wired article about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the upcoming Junior Summit:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;quote&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One topic on the table will be a proposal by five alumni of the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; Junior Summit to start Nation.1 - a virtual nation for children, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; its own voice, flag, and currency, but without borders or centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt; government. This nation would apply for membership to the UN and make</i><br>
<i>&gt; every effort to include children from developing nations. Here is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; excerpt from Nation.1's first proclamation:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As a kid growing up with computers, you have ideas, you see</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities, but they don't count, you're just a kid. Adults need</i><br>
<i>&gt; kids, they just don't realize it. They can't relate to what kids have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to offer, because they don't understand technology the way kids do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Kids have valuable perspectives, but the world offers no mechanism to</i><br>
<i>&gt; voice their opinions. They have no representation in world politics</i><br>
<i>&gt; and they have no influence in the decisions that govern their future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So with the help of the second Junior Summit, a group of young, very</i><br>
<i>&gt; wired individuals is going to bend, twist, and distort some barriers</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the hope those barriers will come undone. We are going to create</i><br>
<i>&gt; a country in cyberspace, not defined by geography or race, but by</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology and age: Nation.1 - a country populated and run by kids.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nation.1 is just beginning, and we are considering how to create</i><br>
<i>&gt; digital political systems, how to deal with language barriers, how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology behind the country will work. We passionately believe it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth it, because uniting kids changes their perspective, widens their</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding, and leads to a better world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Proposals like Nation.1 may seem outrageous, even unthinkable,</i><br>
<i>&gt; compared with what we adults would have suggested. That's the way it</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be: ultimately, the world must go past what adults believe will</i><br>
<i>&gt; succeed. The global information society is ours only to dream - it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be up to these children to live it out.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What I want to know is - why only kids?  I want to have my very own</i><br>
<i>&gt; virtual nation.  NOW! :-(</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So here's an idea - make an extropic virtual nation and get ourselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; represented in the UN, how about TransNation?  or something similar.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyone have any idea if this is possible?</i><br>
