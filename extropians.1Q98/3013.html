Yes, as factors like Moore's Law constrict over time, and the present 18 month doubling<br>
rate for digital power becomes shorter, patents on technology for the present cutting<br>
edge are really worthless, since the typical patent takes at least two years to get<br>
awarded. By that time, the technology is already worth less than half what it was worth<br>
when the patent was issued.<br>
<p>
How can this be fixed? Other than scrapping the patent system altogether (Mr Crocker<br>
jumps up and down in joy), technology developers will either need to practice much more<br>
secrecy, or establish a much faster patent approval system. Create a huge common<br>
database, and create a Certification for any competent engineer to become a Certified<br>
Patent Examiner, where the Examiner is an independent person that will process and<br>
examine patent applications for a flat fee. The examiner would get paid whether or not<br>
the applicant has legitimate patent claims, much like how architects, mining engineers,<br>
civil engineers are always paid, whether or not the prospect works out for the<br>
developer, so there would be little incentive for unethical behavior.<br>

<i>&gt; I'm sure you are aware of the recent reports of a fear of deflation, and I'm sure</i><br>
<i>&gt; you understand them better than I. However, technical areas the technological</i><br>
<i>&gt; deflation is far greater than the economic deflation. As I understand it, one major</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason tht deflation is "bad" is that consumers will defer pruchases to wait for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; price to come down, but for PCS and other hi-tech items, the price is coming down</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway and always has been.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the reason for this is that with the shortening of the depreciation turnover<br>
period, peoples internal discount rates are going up. Since earning power is becoming<br>
more and more related to the competitors present state of technological<br>
competetiveness, making investments in technology now is seen as having a greater NPV<br>
than holding off 6-12 months. There are some areas, though, where that doesn't seem to<br>
matter. In the company I'm currently working with, they do large volumes of mailstream<br>
processing, on an IMB mainframe that is over 20 years old. We are slowly moving some<br>
processing over to a dual Pentium NT server, but there is currently a lack of interest<br>
in further automation, as further automation will mean cutting back on jobs here (and<br>
the boys in charge don't like the idea of becomeing a mom and pop shop. They are<br>
Dartmouth guys, after all). As it is, we offer the lowest cost data conversion and<br>
processing services around, so there really isn't any point in fixing what doesn't seem<br>
to be broke.<br>
