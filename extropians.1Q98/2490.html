The US Constitution applies to non-citizens only as a matter of diplomatic<br>
convention and courtesy. It is a long practice that goes back as long as<br>
governments have had 'full diplomatic relations'. We respect visitors from<br>
other countries like they are honorary citizens, just so that our citizens<br>
traveling elsewhere can enjoy the same respect. That other countries, notably<br>
the less civilized or stable ones, frequently play fast and loose with this<br>
convetion as suits their purposes is what keeps all of the bureaucrats at the<br>
State Department in their job security.<br>
