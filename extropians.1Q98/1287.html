Well, just this month a very small company, Geron Corporation, found a ,  <br>
perhaps the, key to cellular aging. Last year another small company found a <br>
way to clone mammals.<br>
<p>
The breakthrough on High Temperature superconductors was made by IBM at their  <br>
Zurich laboratory, Muller and Bednorz, both IBM employees received Nobel <br>
prizes. The very same IBM lab also made what is unquestionably the single <br>
most important advance in Nanotechnology up to this point, The Scanning <br>
Tunneling Microscope and earned  another Nobel prize for IBM employees Binnig <br>
and Rohrer. IBM is also where the  newer Atomic Force Microscope and Magnetic <br>
Resonance Microscope were invented. They used these machines to make the <br>
smallest possible logo, spelling out the name "IBM" atom by atom a few years <br>
ago. <br>
<p>
IBM didn't do everything, the first laser was made in May 1960 at the private<br>
Hughes Research Laboratory by Harold Maimam. 60 years ago Bell Labs discovered  <br>
that some radio waves come from space and built the world's first radio <br>
telescope, more recently Bell Labs revolutionized Cosmology by detecting the <br>
3 degree Kelvin black body background radiation from The BIG BANG  and got <br>
a Nobel Prize for it. Bell Labs also invented the transistor and got another <br>
Nobel Prize  for that. Texas Instruments invented the integrated circuit, <br>
INTEL invented the microprocessor to fulfill a contract from a Japanese <br>
calculator company.<br>
<p>
A lot of good work comes from private universities. MIT was started in 1845 <br>
by Erastus Bigelow, using the vast fortune he made in the power loom <br>
manufacturing business. CAL TECH is also a privet institution, so is Harvard, <br>
so is Yale, so is Princeton, so is Carnegie Mellon, so is The Institute For<br>
Advanced Study, so is Stanford. Speaking of Standford,  Calvin Quate of that <br>
privet university used an Atomic Force Microscope invented at IBM to make the <br>
worlds smallest transistor. He was able to make  lines less than 100 <br>
nanometers wide. <br>
<p>
Most of the world's great telescopes were built with private funds donated by <br>
rich men, including the largest of all, the 394 inch Keck on Mauna Kea, <br>
a second private instrument of equal size recently became operational just <br>
a few  hundred feet away. I think it's interesting that one of the biggest <br>
contributors to Big Science, Charles Yerkes, made much of his money by <br>
building street car lines, until government put him out of business when <br>
they decided they could  run them much, much better. None of the men who <br>
gave money for these things expected their telescope to make a profit. <br>
If government wasn't around to steal a large pat of their money people like <br>
this would give even more. <br>
  <br>
I don't want to oversell my case, there is no doubt that some good science <br>
has come from government funded research, and that's not surprising <br>
considering that government has trillions of dollars at it's disposal. Even a <br>
monkey throwing around that kind of money would occasionally do some good.<br>
