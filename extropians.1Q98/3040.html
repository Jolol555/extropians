<i>&gt;I'm writing this directly to you, but if you wish</i><br>

<i>&gt;I joined your freedom list for a short amount of time</i><br>
<i>&gt;to see how you and other list members were advancing</i><br>
<i>&gt;in this area, because I found little or no reason to</i><br>
<i>&gt;help I did not respond.  This was due to a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;degree of paranoia on my part to anyone who has</i><br>
<i>&gt;cleared what I believe your "deep pemes" to mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;from their mind.  I have studied this area myself</i><br>
<i>&gt;and have drawn some conclusions that justify this</i><br>
<i>&gt;paranoia.  Firstly, I never applied these ideas in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ways you have and never created "peme rules"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(which, BTW, correspond to my own experiences</i><br>
<i>&gt;completely.)  When discussing these topics I used</i><br>
<i>&gt;to talk of a 'political food chain' - occupying</i><br>
<i>&gt;the top are 'originators' (these would be "deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;peme" creators) with 'propagators' of various</i><br>
<i>&gt;kinds (in your terms these would be creators of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"surface pemes" and followers of "surface pemes")</i><br>
<i>&gt;all the way down.  If, in fact, you have cleared</i><br>
<i>&gt;"deep pemes" from your mind, then your political</i><br>
<i>&gt;biases (of attacking authority) is part of your</i><br>
<i>&gt;own egoistic pursuits.  From my own exploration</i><br>
<i>&gt;of these ideas I have found 'originators' to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;the most dangerous of persons, although I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;my doubts to whether any truly exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is my belief that a "deep peme" cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt;created by someone who is 'infected' with "deep</i><br>
<i>&gt;pemes."  It follows that 'originators' would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be what you call "deep anarchists" (although</i><br>
<i>&gt;I disagree with your terminology, as "anarchist"</i><br>
<i>&gt;is a highly political standpoint that is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;result of infection, I have always referred</i><br>
<i>&gt;to myself as "non-political.")  Also, if an</i><br>
<i>&gt;'originator' wished to gain control of others</i><br>
<i>&gt;he or she would do so by first ridding them</i><br>
<i>&gt;of those deep pemes created by others, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;simultaneously establishing a new set of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"deep pemes" (in your case anti-authority.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Obviously I have nothing against your or</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone else's egoistic pursuits (true</i><br>
<i>&gt;decentralisation can only occur when all</i><br>
<i>&gt;entities populate the top of the 'political</i><br>
<i>&gt;food chain').  I'm just trying to determine</i><br>
<i>&gt;your own standpoint.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The 'Political Food Chain'<br>
--------------------------<br>
<p>
1. Deep pemes                          Originators/<br>
   ("constitution," "president,"       Deep Anarchists<br>
   "authority," "emperor," etc.)<br>
   Political Concepts<br>
<p>
2. Surface pemes                       Propagators/<br>
   ("the public interest," etc.)       Phobocrats<br>
   Political Beliefs<br>
<p>
3. Toxic memes                         Followers<br>
   ("he made me angry," etc.)          Rebels<br>
   Personal Self-Defeating Beliefs<br>
<p>
<p>
I find it interesting that your experiences<br>
accord with the Peme Rules -- they are of<br>
course slightly overstated (but not for<br>
some Followers and Rebels!)<br>
<p>
My list of Originators:<br>
1. William of Ockham<br>
2. Voltaire<br>
3. Jonathan Swift<br>
4. Lysander Spooner<br>
5. Max Stirner<br>
6. Friedrich Nietzsche<br>
7. Hans Vaihinger<br>
8. George Gurdjieff<br>
9. Aleister Crowley<br>
10. Ron Hubbard<br>
11. Timothy Leary<br>
12. Robert Anton Wilson<br>
13. Hakim Bey<br>
14. Max More<br>
<p>
Who else should I add to my list?<br>
<p>
The primary characteristic of Originators is<br>
their *ability and willingness to question<br>
everything*.  I suspect all the above had or<br>
have this quality.<br>
<p>
I don't think any of my Originators have<br>
cleared out all their deep pemes.  They<br>
could be regared as Proto-Deep Anarchists.<br>
(As a result of my identification of the<br>
Peme Conflict Principle, I discovered that<br>
I also have more deep pemes to tackle.)<br>
<p>
Originators are extremely dangerous to the<br>
status quo -- provided they can get people<br>
to listen to them.  (There are, and probably<br>
have been, many more unknown Originators<br>
who failed at getting people to listen to<br>
them.)<br>
<p>
I don't "attack authority."  I attack the<br>
very *idea* or *notion* of "authority"<br>
(so-called).  The notion of "authority"<br>
in the political sense is a deep peme.<br>
(To regard Einstein as an authority on<br>
relativity is valid.)  All so-called<br>
"political authority" is bogus -- hucksters<br>
who call themselves "president," "emperor,"<br>
etc. and suckers who believe them.<br>
<p>
I certainly am not "anti-authority"<br>
because from my perspective there isn't<br>
any so-called "authority" to be against.<br>
There are only pretended "authorities"<br>
-- and Followers who believe and obey<br>
them, and Rebels who believe and fight<br>
them.<br>
<p>
Hubbard was a master at helping people<br>
remove some of their toxic memes, then<br>
installing his own toxic memes to create<br>
Loyal Followers.  As far as I know, Hubbard<br>
never addressed what I consider deep pemes.<br>
<p>
I think that someone with deep pemes can<br>
both help others remove deep pemes and<br>
install new deep pemes.<br>
<p>
By "anarchist" I mean someone who has no<br>
ruler and doesn't rule others.  I would<br>
agree with you that an anarchist operating<br>
at the Rebel level ("anti-authority") is<br>
infected -- he hasn't shed the *idea* of<br>
"authority" (so-called).  He doesn't realize<br>
that the hucksters masquerading as "emperor,"<br>
"president," etc. are imposters and liars.<br>
<p>
You say, "...[T]rue decentralisation can<br>
only occur when all entities populate the<br>
top of the 'political food chain'."  You're<br>
right.  Coercive politics is about those<br>
higher on the 'chain' "eating out the<br>
substance" of those lower on the 'chain.'<br>
To prevent having your "substance eaten<br>
out," you have to raise yourself to the<br>
top of the 'polical food chain.'<br>
<p>
Deep Anarchists of the world, escape from<br>
the 'political food chain' hierarchies and<br>
disperse at the top!<br>
