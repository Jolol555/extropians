I'm sure my opinion should be suspect, as this image doesn't seem to include a<br>
role for lawyers, but, with all due respect, this seems like an unworkable<br>
nightmare.  Most factual disputes worth trying in any court are so because the<br>
facts are debatable, even by forensic experts.  Ultimately someone has to make<br>
decisions of such disputed fact questions and any "electronic justice" able to<br>
make such decisions would have to evidence at least as much intelligence and<br>
-- more importantly -- wisdom as a human judge or jury.  <br>
<p>
While crimes committed in thoroughly "surveilled" public areas might someday<br>
be susceptible to more "objective" fact-finding than we have today, crimes and<br>
intentional torts would just happen in less observable locales.  Unless every<br>
square centimeter of every possible habitat is perfectly observed, committed<br>
murderers or frauds will simply commit their acts in the least observed zones.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't think a transparent society would be any</i><br>

<i>&gt;  one way to find out. Until that time, it would be very bold indeed to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  dismiss the idea alltogether. Anyway, I don't advocate _total_</i><br>
transparency,<br>
<i>&gt;  just "perfect" monitoring of public areas, not homes, offices etc. (that's </i><br>
<i>&gt; up</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to every individual) for increased safety "on the steets" and justice</i><br>
<i>&gt;  based on hard evidence, not flawed human witnesses. It seems that </i><br>
<i>&gt;  more and more people agee (the surveillance systems are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  popping up all over the world like crazy -- and are helping to take a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  bite out of crime), so as surveillance technology gets cheaper, smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and better the "(semi-)transparent society" seems almost inevitable, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  whether we like it or not.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that improved surveillance systems will and should be used in "hot<br>
spots" -- predictable locales for crime.  One can imagine all sorts of clever<br>
devices that would improve on the now-ubiquitous video cameras in places like<br>
urban convenience stores.  (Here's one -- a system in the doorway that, upon<br>
detection of a gunshot or certain key phrases, automatically fires a small<br>
probe to extract a DNA sample and a cloud of microscopic tracking devices from<br>
the next n persons passing through the doorway . . .)  But, anything less than<br>
total surveillance of all possible locales for crime will still leave a need<br>
for "flawed human witnesses" in any justice system.<br>
<p>
I remain deeply suspicious of the concept of a completely "transparent<br>
society" -- primarily for reasons other than the ones discussed here.  But on<br>
this point, I doubt seriously whether the idea is any panacea for justice.<br>
