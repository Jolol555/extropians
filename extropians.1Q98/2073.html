"True freedom requires a life without boundaries."<br>
<p>
So read the advertisement I saw on the Tube the other day for the re-styled<br>
Royal Automobile Club, which now looks more like NASA. I'm not a member,<br>
and I don't need to be from a motoring point of view. But that<br>
advertisement struck me like a Millwall supporter, and I 'phoned the<br>
number. Needless to say, the person on the other end of the telephone tried<br>
to sell me a membership.<br>
<p>
But what are "boundaries" anyway? Show me a boundary, and, unless you show<br>
me the event horizon boundary caused by the limit on the speed of light, I<br>
will probably be able to show you your imagination.<br>
<p>
We know from our early physics lessons that everything around us affects<br>
everything else. What you feel, smell or see is affected in some small way<br>
by the very action of you perceiving it. There is little to distinguish a<br>
tool that I make from a tool that I am born with. They are both a part of<br>
me, different only in the degrees to which they are useful and easily<br>
replacable. There is no stark boundary around me. There is only an<br>
extensive, fuzzy zone where I blur into my surroundings.<br>
<p>
So, imagine that I am seriously injured, and have been rushed to hospital.<br>
But all the surgeons are having a Christmas party. "Send him away," they<br>
clamour. "We're having fun here!"<br>
<p>
I die.<br>
<p>
Did the surgeons cause my death? Obviously not: they merely failed to<br>
prevent it. Or did they? Where is the boundary surrounding the set of<br>
events which caused my death? How does one distinguish an event which<br>
CAUSED my death from one which merely FAILED TO PREVENT it? I challenge<br>
anyone to produce a satisfactory criterion. Again, there is no stark<br>
boundary. There are only differences in the degree to which one event<br>
contributes to another.<br>
<p>
The introductory message to this list claims that Extropians may have an<br>
interest in "rational ethics (ethics for survival and flourishing)". This<br>
must surprise a lot of list members, who seem to take a far more<br>
libertarian view of ethics. Many here seem to take the view that it's OK to<br>
do what you like, so long as you don't harm anyone else. I challenge those<br>
people to place a boundary around causing "harm to anyone else". Every<br>
action a person takes will affect every other person to some small extent.<br>
You can't live your life without causing harm to someone else. All you can<br>
do is mitigate the degree of harm whilst promoting your objectives. I for<br>
one have an interest in the "rational ethics" declared in the introduction.<br>
<p>
Which brings me, finally, to the point. <br>
<p>
Someone you know, rationally, carefully and thoughtfully, decides that it<br>
is time to end their life. Such an action has a number of easily<br>
identifiable anti-Extropic effects.<br>
<p>
What is the right thing to do? Do you give the person their liberty, or do<br>
you exercise your "ethics for survival and flourishing" and forcibly remove<br>
it?<br>
<p>
Regards,<br>
Darren<br>
