I don't post often and have only been reading the list for a few months so if<br>
this is totally out of line, sorry, but this post troubles me for some reason.<br>
<p>
<p>
I am kind of curious as to how you are defining civilization here. Don't get me<br>
wrong, they did stamp out ignorance and such, but at what cost? I tend to think<br>
that more was lost than was actually gained by this as many cery colourful and<br>
diverse cultures were lost or sometimes conveniently irradicated in the name of<br>
progress. <br>
<p>
History is not my area of expertise at all, so if i am completely off base here<br>
I welcome any corrections. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is unfortunate that today's mass media doesn't give us the ability to repeat the</i><br>
<i>&gt; success that was the British colonial era. I daresay that the British in that era</i><br>
<i>&gt; did more to spread civilization than anyone before, or possibly since.</i><br>
