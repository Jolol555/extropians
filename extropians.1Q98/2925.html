hmm...interesting.  But it doesn't convince me that they wouldn't have<br>
gone if Castro wasn't there.  Why do the approximately 1 million<br>
Mexicans/year that sneak into the US do so?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By the way, what on Earth were you trying to get at when you said  </i><br>
<i>&gt; "perceived, at least"?               </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
perceived by them, i meant.  That is, standard of living is an extremely<br>
subjective scale, and obviously there would be heaps of people that would<br>
disagree with that "fact" above.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;Castro did not inherit a poor country, in 1959 it had the third         </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;highest standard of living in the western hemisphere, only the USA         </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;and Canada were higher. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I would love to see some reference for that interesting bit of         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;information, or preferably ten.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then look up a encyclopedia or almanac from 1959, if you want 9 more then </i><br>
<i>&gt; look up 9 more.</i><br>
<p>
Really?  It would have to be a pretty shitty encyclopedia which claims to<br>
have an absolute on a "standard of living" scale.  Did you mean that they<br>
had the 3rd highest GDP/capita in America?  I wouldn't disagree with that<br>
(even though i doubt it, it would be easy enough to look up), but i would<br>
have to see quite a bit more stats (eg lifespan, literacy, average<br>
wealth, %top 20/ %bottom 20, work hours per week) to assert that<br>
they had the 3rd highest "standard of living", and since you already seem<br>
to have found it, it would save me a whole heap of trouble if you would<br>
point me to the relevant sources.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;The fact that for a few days in 1962 Castro brought the human race         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;closer to the brink of extinction than anytime in the last ten         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;thousand years does not increase my admiration of him.                     </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;I never really understood the problem in there.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The problem was global extinction. The USSR withdrew its nuclear missiles </i><br>
<i>&gt; from Cuba over the strong objection of Castro. Neither side can find much to </i><br>
<i>&gt; brag about in their nuclear policy but the fact remains, if the USSR had done </i><br>
<i>&gt; what Castro was urging them to do there would have been a nuclear war, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we wouldn't be having this pleasant conversation today, not just because </i><br>
<i>&gt; there wouldn't be an Internet, but because there wouldn't be a you and there </i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't be a me.                  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; During the crisis most of the president's advisers, including all the </i><br>
<i>&gt; military ones, were urging the President not to wait and to take action </i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately. For example, Chief of the U.S Air Force, General Curtis LeMay </i><br>
<i>&gt; (a VERY scary man) and the head of the Strategic Air Command, Thomas Powers </i><br>
<i>&gt; (even LeMay called him a sadist) told the president that if we didn't order </i><br>
<i>&gt; the missile sites in Cuba bombed within the hour it would be a blot on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; honor of the U.S.A. Kennedy asked LeMay what he thought the Soviets would do </i><br>
<i>&gt; if he did that. LeMay said he understood how the soviets think and because </i><br>
<i>&gt; such an attack would be bound to kill lots of Russians manning the site they </i><br>
<i>&gt; couldn't let it pass, he said they would probably retaliate by bombing our</i><br>
<i>&gt; medium range nuclear missiles in Turkey. Kennedy asked what we should do then, </i><br>
<i>&gt; LeMay said such an attack would kill American solders and that would have to </i><br>
<i>&gt; be avenged by bombing nuclear missile sites in the USSR itself. Kennedy asked </i><br>
<i>&gt; what the Soviets would do then, LeMay said he hoped at that point cooler </i><br>
<i>&gt; heads would prevail.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually it was even worse than that. We now know from recently declassified </i><br>
<i>&gt; USSR archives that the nuclear missiles in Cuba were fully operational in </i><br>
<i>&gt; October 1962 and that the Russian field commanders were authorized to fire </i><br>
<i>&gt; them on their own authority if it looked like the missiles were about to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; destroyed or captured. The field commanders had the launch codes! Castro</i><br>
<i>&gt; knew this, Kennedy did not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;            </i><br>
<i>&gt; The USA thought incorrectly that the missiles were not yet operational and </i><br>
<i>&gt; they never dreamed they could be fired without a direct order from Moscow. </i><br>
<i>&gt; We also know that the USA was absolutely determined to get rid of the missiles </i><br>
<i>&gt; one way or another, if they were not removed by diplomacy in a matter of days </i><br>
<i>&gt; they would send an air strike to destroy them. As I said, the human race </i><br>
<i>&gt; never came closer to extinction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't often say nice things about Communist dictators but I will now,   </i><br>
<i>&gt; Khrushchev had the intelligence to see the insanity in the situation and had   </i><br>
<i>&gt; the guts to back down. Castro was absolutely furious at Khrushchev's decision   </i><br>
<i>&gt; to remove the missiles and never forgave him for it. Khrushchev often made</i><br>
<i>&gt; bloodthirsty speeches but he really didn't want to be a mass murderer on such  </i><br>
<i>&gt; a vast scale, but Castro would rather destroy the world than be embarrassed.   </i><br>
<i>&gt; If Castro was the dictator of the USSR and not Cuba, you and I and everyone   </i><br>
<i>&gt; we know would be dead.                            </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
Thank you for that account, now in the case that the US had nuclear<br>
weapons targeted at Cuba, as i'm assuming they had  (it's pretty funny<br>
that we have details of the decisions and state of weaponry of "closed<br>
dictatorships", but not about an "open democracy"), how is Castro any more<br>
responsible about this escallation than Kennedy?  Why is Kennedy praised<br>
for being the hard man while Castro is satanised?  From your above<br>
account, the only guy who didn't seem to be a complete psycho was<br>
Khrushchev. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Didn't (or doesn't) the US have nuclear weapons pointed at Cuba? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know, it's top secret, but I doubt it, there's nothing important in  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Cuba anymore, not militarily or economically or scientifically or </i><br>
<i>&gt; artistically or...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
what about then (1962)?<br>
        <br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Anarcho-socialists, is that anything like jumbo shrimp?                  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Not a government but an entity which is designated by some method by         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;the voluntary members of the group or commune which the entity is         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;going to direct.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know what you mean by "entity" and I don't know how it's "designated" </i><br>
<i>&gt; or who does it, but I think I do know what you mean by "voluntary", join us </i><br>
<i>&gt; or take a bullet in the brain, you're free to choose.</i><br>
<p>
I thought you were asking, and i was giving you a definition, but you<br>
don't seem to like that.  No, in the kind of anarcho-socialism i had in<br>
mind, voluntary means more along the lines of "Do you care to join us?", i<br>
think it would work better than the option you gave.  Entity is just that,<br>
an entity.  It is purposefully left ambiguous to accomodate to the<br>
group/commune.  Same thing with designated.<br>
<i> &gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Anarcho-capitalism is just a special case of this by setting group         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;is equal to each indivual.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A government is an organization that claims a monopoly on the legal use of </i><br>
<i>&gt; force and has the power to enforce its claim most of the time. In  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anarcho-capitalism no group has rights an individual does not have. So what </i><br>
<i>&gt; the hell are Anarcho-socialists?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The same as anarcho-capitalists, substituting the group/comune mentioned<br>
above for the individual.  That is inside the commune, the rules/laws are<br>
up to the commune/group, outside, the commune's relations to other<br>
commune's are simmilar to inter-individual relations in an<br>
anarcho-capitalist society (or whatever you feel like calling it).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;In the common case, the commune is a group of people that choose to         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;live together, and the entity that directs them are the people         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;themselves, and usually they don't do any enforcing since there is         </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;nothing to enforce cos most private property is abolished.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;         </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Fine, you have a perfect right to do that and I have not the slightest  </i><br>
<i>&gt; objection. I presume everyone on this list believes in the Scientific Method, </i><br>
<i>&gt; so let's put it to the test, start your socialist commune today, I'll stick </i><br>
<i>&gt; with business, and we'll see which one turns out to be freer and more </i><br>
<i>&gt; prosperous. I have no desire to stop you, and anyway I have a pretty good </i><br>
<i>&gt; idea which one of us will win the contest, but by all means, try to prove me </i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong. If you do then you will have beaten me fair and square in the free </i><br>
<i>&gt; market of ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I get the impression that our positions are not symmetric however, that you  </i><br>
<i>&gt; do have a strong desire to stop me. If I'm wrong about that then I apologize </i><br>
<i>&gt; and we have no disagreement over morality, only over the technical points of  </i><br>
<i>&gt; economics, and there is no need to worry about that, nature will let us know </i><br>
<i>&gt; which one of us is correct, no doubt about it. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I don't have any desire to stop you at all.  In fact, i would say that<br>
anarcho-capitalist and anarcho-socialist societies could live rather<br>
peacefully alongside each other, but i'm no more able to setup an<br>
anarchosocialist commune than you are of setting up an anarchocapitalist<br>
one since any kind of current power structure wouldn't let either of them<br>
exist. I also have a pretty good idea of which one would be freer.<br>
