<i>&gt; The goal IMHO should be drugs that are as independent of set and</i><br>
<i>&gt; setting as possible - they should work even if you don't believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; them. Sure, set and setting can build a lot on this, but without a</i><br>
<i>&gt; strong pharmacological basis you could as well eat sugar pills and use</i><br>
<i>&gt; the placebo constructively.</i><br>
<p>
Well put. I'm often wondering if the effects I enjoy on the drug are<br>
learned and only triggered psychological reactions to being drugged.<br>
<p>
What do you think about the effects of meditation and relaxation on<br>
creativity?<br>
<p>
For a while, I considered that perhaps hemp put me into a state similar to<br>
that of a meditation guru.  Perhaps this sent me down the road to thinking<br>
I was really short cutting years of serious mental discipline...?<br>
<p>
<p>
Above you discuss that everyone seems to have a biased view point and that<br>
I can certainly agree with. But what about the effects on artists that<br>
have learned to use the drugs during the creative process? I can clearly<br>
see the science in isolating the effects of hemp on inexperienced<br>
subjects.<br>
<p>
I remember that when I first tried to smoke it and create music I was<br>
completely unproductive. With all of this computer and synthesis<br>
technology around me, not to mention the recording technology, I was<br>
completely lost. It took some trial and error for me to get comfortable<br>
doing complex things under the influence. HOWEVER, once I passed through<br>
this stage, it seemed that overcoming that barrier had given me a more<br>
intuitive relationship with the gear. Sort of like taking off the ankle<br>
weights and jumping around. My mind seemed lighter and more flexible in a<br>
way. As an experimental musician, I found my experiences more profound and<br>
informed by that less tangible portion of consciousness. What is<br>
intuition? Perhaps I'm using it too liberally. But I still find that under<br>
the influence my mind seems to flow better while immersed inside of the<br>
web of technocomplexity. If I was an engineer /scientist it may be<br>
different, but for artists, I think we all have the same story to tell<br>
when under the influence of hemp. (if you don't mind me speaking on behalf<br>
of you out there..)<br>
<p>
all right.. enough ranting...rambling...<br>
