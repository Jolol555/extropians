We may become gods in a few decades, but we won't become Gods at least<br>
until the end of the universe. The moral responsibilities of a God with<br>
unlimited resources must be qualitatively different from those of a god<br>
who is merely unimaginably powerful.<br>
<p>
A God with unlimited resources has a responsbility to create a globally<br>
optimal universe for his creatures. It is conceivable that our universe is<br>
actually the best of all possible worlds, but it doesn't seem likely.<br>
If we can figure out how far away from optimum this universe is, it may<br>
allow us to get an estimate of the computational power of the god that<br>
created it.<br>
