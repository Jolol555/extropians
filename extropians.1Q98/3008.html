<i>&gt; &gt; every bit of information is tide to every other</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; and you've got to change it all.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd only need to do that if I wanted to make the</i><br>

<i>&gt; I just wanted to fuck it up.</i><br>
                <br>
Okay, so I've got 2 Million bits of data inherently linked to each<br>
other, and a system that works by following links and comparing data. <br>
I'm afraid your new data wouldn't stand much of a chance if it weren't<br>
correctly linked.  It'd either never be discovered in the first place<br>
or be ignored because it was orphaned from all the other data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Besides, this is an autonomous meta network,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; everything you do creates additional data.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It creates contradictory data and a huge amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; it. All that crap must be examined with software</i><br>
<i>&gt; tools, tools vulnerable to tampering.</i><br>
<p>
Contradictory!  Bits of data that say you just created these bits of<br>
data.  Even if you changed the name of the person who created them,<br>
who cares? They're not properly linked, can't be found by software<br>
agents, and have no effect on the network.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; you can't hack in because it has nothing to hack</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; into (it's open, remember?).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I remember, that's why It would be easy as pie to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make the network useless.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, open systems make it near impossible to do anything that is<br>
damaging.  As soon as you stop trying to keep people out you have to<br>
look at the situation from an entirely different perspective.  If<br>
anyone can get into the system, then you don't want to let anyone do<br>
damage.  This calls for low-level security - building a system where<br>
you *can't* do those things (not that doesn't let you.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Far from  trying to destroy the data I would make</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands or millions of copies of it, all suitably</i><br>
<i>&gt; mutated of course, and leave you the job of</i><br>
<i>&gt; determining the truth.</i><br>
<p>
Me!  Noise only creates problems for you.  Like, where are you putting<br>
it all?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If it's hard for me to find stuff on the network</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's hard for everybody, so what's the point of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; network?</i><br>
<p>
Finding *that* piece of data you want to destroy is hard, the data is<br>
entangled in many different locations and many other pieces of data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's probably untrue and certainly irrelevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The perfect world would be one where everybody and</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything was open, except for me.</i><br>
<p>
I'm still unsure as to what you would do with that 'advantage'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; There's are no network administrators, it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; completely distributed autonomous anarchy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If it can do that then it's no longer an autonomous</i><br>
<i>&gt; network, it's an autonomous AI and all bets are off</i><br>
<i>&gt; in predicting what it will decide to do with a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fifth wheel like the human race.</i><br>
<p>
Admin-less networks are being created now, and they don't use any AI. <br>
They just don't have administrators.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;But the data must be machine-readable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see your point, cryptographic data is</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost always machine-readable.</i><br>
<p>
The joys of passing public keys around every time a piece of<br>
information needs to be linked, read, moved, copied, annotated, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; For the sake of argument, let's say you managed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; secret communication.  Who would you send</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; communicate with?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My banker.</i><br>
<p>
Better make sure he doesn't use a computer when banking.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Here's the money I made from selling 26 tones of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cocaine to children, don't pay taxes on any of it,</i><br>
<i>&gt; just put it in a standard anonymous encrypted</i><br>
<i>&gt; account."</i><br>
<p>
So there's a point to a one-person monetary system now?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "Tell your Russian friend that 7 tones of heroin is</i><br>
<i>&gt; too much to pay for his H bomb, it's only 3</i><br>
<i>&gt; megatons for goodness sake and it's not like he's</i><br>
<i>&gt; the only one around selling nukes, I refuse to go</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher than 6 tons of marijuana, take it or leave</i><br>
<i>&gt; it."</i><br>
<p>
You want weapons?  The plans are on the network, and the location of<br>
the materials.  Suddenly the black market becomes a little less<br>
profitable when everyone knows how to roll their own.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What can you steal from an open society?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Money and power, and because of that it won't be</i><br>
<i>&gt; open for long.</i><br>
<p>
So you're waving your wads of encrypted dollar bills with your face<br>
printed on the front.  Why do they give a shit?  It's like a caveman<br>
taking his pebbles to the bank.  And I'm not sure where you got this<br>
power from, they only thing you know that they don't is yourself. <br>
"What's John going to next?" - not much because his constantly hiding<br>
from every computer, every door, every video, every street, every<br>
road, and every person.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; How can you bribe an open society?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; With money and power.</i><br>
<p>
"Hi, I have money and power, give me more money and power, thank you"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; What have you got that they haven't?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Money and power.</i><br>
<p>
The money's useless, and the power... where did that come from exactly?<br>
