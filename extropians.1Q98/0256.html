Ok, I see what you mean, and I agree. I would guess that it might be more<br>
convenient to move information around instead of energy, but you're right<br>
that the same thermodynamic effect can be achieved either way.<br>
<p>
Earlier you mentioned that most normal forms of matter has maximum entropy<br>
that is proportional to mass, but a black hole has entropy that is<br>
proportional to the square of its mass. Of course this is what allows<br>
black holes to have such low temperatures and be used as heat sinks. But<br>
what I'm wondering is if there is some non-black-hole arrangement of<br>
matter that has maximum entropy that is proportional to the square of its<br>
mass (and has a reasonable volume). If such a thing exists then we can<br>
perhaps use it as a memory store and never have to erase anything. <br>
