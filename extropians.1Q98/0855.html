Hi,<br>
<p>
For those interested, Albert's reaction to winning the Loebner Contest<br>
is online (and unedited) at<br>
<p>

Several people have asked if Albert is named after Einstein, to which<br>
the answer is no. Albert is named after a child I met while we were<br>
both doing time at the scotish rite children's hospital around '74-75.<br>
The real Albert had a rare form of arthritis that made it impossible<br>
for him to get out of bed. I watched them take him screaming to PT<br>
twice a day for 3 weeks. I realized then that there is more to life<br>
than just being here.<br>
<p>
That's all I'll have to say about Loebner's show unless they fail to<br>
send me my prize, in which case I hope to enlist the aid of<br>
SpaceHitler to help me fry their fucking brains!<br>
<p>

Apols to all for my extremely accurate reportage of the Loebner<br>
Prize. My other isp has been down for several days, which has given me<br>
time to meditate upon the evil of my ways. Just goes to show, you<br>
*can't* believe everything you read on the 'net.<br>
<p>
Stay tuned for my future revelations:<br>

	Nixon: Not Guilty After All<br>
	Research finds: Earth Really Is Flat<br>
<p>
So here's a neat little link to amuse you:<br>
