Really.  Can you give an example of some scientist<br>
who claims to control the weather?<br>
<p>
: This dangerous perspective is responsible for the<br>
: misuse of advancements in science which have led to one of<br>
: the worst eras of earths history, in terms of pollution.<br>
<p>
One of the "Draco's Tavern" short stories, by Larry Niven, features<br>
an alien who has been roaming the galaxy at relativistic speeds for<br>
over a billion years realtime.  She says, "I was here once before.<br>
Then, too, there was a high civilization.  But they knew they were<br>
doomed: a green slime was spreading over the oceans, changing the<br>
atmosphere."<br>
<p>
Humans have done nothing remotely comparable to the pollution<br>
wrought by green plants (though we'll soon have the ability to<br>
match it, or at least to match some of the lesser catastrophes<br>
like the Chicxulub event).<br>
<p>
But for the sake of argument let's restrict the question to *human*<br>
history.  Has pollution _per capita_ gotten worse?  Increased pollution<br>
is mainly due to increased activity, imho, not to increased science.<br>
Surely it is (if anything) the *opposite* of scientific hubris to think<br>
that your activities will not affect the world - i.e. that you can use<br>
the world as an infinite waste-sink, without causing pollution.<br>

Pollution begins at home!  Where's my bong?<br>
