Actually, well crafted and evolved machines are perceived as living<br>
things. For example racing cars, ferraris, quality boats, etc. So<br>
there's something about ease of interfacing involved here. Computer<br>
interfaces are very new and haven't had time to become comfortable to<br>
use.<br>
<p>
There is also the legacy of the steam age. Steam engines were the first<br>
self powered machines, and were highly repetitious, with a very fixed<br>
suite of behaviour. This is similar to the actions of retarded and<br>
autistic and mentally ill people, so we perceive this kind of behaviour<br>
with dread and rejection, as broken people are not in general either<br>
useful or a survival advantage. This dread may come from levels as deep<br>
as our limbic system. Both machines and broken people can make<br>
unpredictable inept decisions which are survival negative...<br>
