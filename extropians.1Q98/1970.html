It is effectively impossible to buy sovereignty, so as long as people are<br>
stuck on this planet, you have to look for the best choices under the<br>
constraints given.  The Alaskan coastal islands are a pretty good match.<br>
Advantages: lots of resources, sovereignty of a relatively benign<br>
government, proximity to high tech, virtually no force of law (you really<br>
have to go there to believe how far this really goes), and a reasonable<br>
price.  You may not get your own country, but what you do get is damn close<br>
for all intents and purposes and no one is going to mess with you.<br>
<p>
While you may be able to obtain "sovereignty" from some small, poor<br>
country, it is unlikely that your sovereignty will carry any weight and<br>
will almost certainly be contested very strongly (i.e. it could be<br>
retracted at will by the granting country).  Short of<br>
coopting/buying/overthrowing the dictator-of-the-month of some banana<br>
republic, you have no real options for obtaining "legitimate" sovereignty.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
The coastal islands *are* mild, with a seasonal temperature range of<br>
20-80F; much better than most of the continental US (unless you've been<br>
spoiled by California weather ;^).  Tropical volcanic islands are usually<br>
already well populated, since this is where most of the usable/farmable<br>
landmass is in the ocean.  Additionally, there is the nasty problem of<br>
volcanic activity (consider Montserat), which appears to be considerably<br>
more frequent for island volcanoes, most likely due to their proximity to<br>
active subduction zones and tectonic seams.  You would be much better off<br>
buying an island that has been created by plate crumpling around subduction<br>
zones; these are usually found in proximity to island volcanoes, but around<br>
the rims of the ocean.  Unfortunately, essentially all of these types of<br>
islands are owned by countries that would never consider selling you<br>
sovereignty.  Tropical would be nice, but most islands worth considering<br>
are not equatorial; in fact there are few islands in the equatorial regions<br>
and virtually all of those are atolls.<br>
