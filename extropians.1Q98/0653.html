Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt;Like most of the substances discussed here the placebo effect plays a</i><br>
<i>&gt;huge role. I suppose that if you eat something that gives you more</i><br>
<i>&gt;energy, think it will have beneficial effects you will become more</i><br>
<i>&gt;assertive.</i><br>
<p>
We could call it a secondary effect, and that represents one of the <br>
problems in discussing supplements--they are usually advertised by <br>
their secondary effects rather than the actual process they have an <br>
affect on.  To take a supplement on the basis of its secondary <br>
effects can lead to poor or damaging choices in relation <br>
to life extension programs.  <br>
<p>
To use Sasha's original question as an example (hope he doesn't<br>
mind), I saw a red flag on the mention of l-carnitine, because I knew<br>
that it is used in thermogenic formulas, and Sasha doesn't own an<br>
ounce of extra fat on him!  Now, whether Sasha's svelt figure is the<br>
result of diligent diet, exercise, or simply a good supply of his own<br>
l-carnitine, I don't know.  But for him to ingest l-carnitine on the<br>
basis of its energy----&gt;agressiveness enhancing effect might result<br>
in a situation where he had to begin ingesting a higher level of<br>
calories, thereby increasing his glucolic metabolism and reducing his<br>
own supply of DHEA, which he may or may not be keeping track of<br>
through medical testing, and require him to increase his DHEA<br>
supplementation to maintain longivity levels. Now, given the data<br>
Anders provided on the neural effects of l-carnitine, Sasha might<br>
decide that it is worth the juggling act to take a quantity of it,<br>
but he would have to understand its primary effects in order to make<br>
that choice in the first place.  <br>
<p>
