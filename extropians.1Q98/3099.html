<p>
Prove  his innocence? In the USA about 40,000 murders are committed each year,  <br>
with a liberal interpretation of the word "prove" I might be able to prove I  <br>
didn't commit 75% of them, unfortunately that leaves 10,000 murders I'm <br>
unable to prove I didn't commit.<br>

<i>	&gt;Human judges would still have a place in this system as controllers </i><br>

<i>	&gt;of the known facts with a recommendation (xx% chance that guilty of </i><br>
<i>	&gt;crime xx resulting in punishment no. xx). </i><br>
	     <br>
<p>
Just add up the facts and crank out a conclusion, It's a real shame that <br>
wisdom can't be achieved that easily, we would have had super intelligent <br>
computers long ago, although they'd be too busy changing the universe to <br>
concern themselves with human beings and their petty disputes.<br>

<p>
<i>	&gt;there are lie detectors that, although still not too reliable, have </i><br>
<i>	&gt;an intimidating effect on all but the toughest suspects </i><br>
	     <br>
<p>
Yes they are intimidating, to the innocent as well as the guilty. I would  <br>
agree to have a lie detector test only if I was guilty and about to be <br>
convicted.  I've read a little about them and I think I'd have a better than <br>
50% chance of beating the machine, unless of course the operator didn't like <br>
me, interpretation the machine's output is largely subjective.<br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;hard questioning. This means causing physical/mental nonlethal/not </i><br>
<i>	&gt;permanently damaging discomfort the suspect in order to extract a </i><br>
<i>	&gt;detailed confession (no words shall be put in the suspect's mouth, </i><br>
<i>	&gt;and a confession alone can't convict; details only known to the </i><br>
<i>	&gt;murderer/thief etc. must be forthcoming). </i><br>
<p>
	     <br>
You say you didn't murder anybody but I suspect you may have, so like a good  <br>
policeman I bring you in for some hard questioning. After I pull your third <br>
fingernail off by the roots with a pair of pliers your demeanor changes and  <br>
you insist that I was absolutely correct in every respect and that you did <br>
indeed commit the crime in question, however information about the deed that <br>
only the murderer would know is not forthcoming.  After I pull off all ten of <br>
your fingernails your claims of being a killer of the vilest sort are even <br>
more vigorous, but despite my insistence that you do so you still tell me no <br>
details of the crime not generally known.  <br>
<p>
What should a reasonable policeman such as myself do at this point?<br>
<p>
1) Conclude that the reason you don't tell me the details is that you don't <br>
   know them, give you an apology for any inconvenience and a discount coupon  <br>
   to the nearest nail cloning salon, thank you for being a good sport about <br>
   this little misunderstanding and send you home, OR<br>
<p>
2) Conclude that you're just being stubborn and get to work on your toenails.<br>

<i>	&gt;crime rates would be down considerably due to decriminalization of </i><br>
<i>	&gt;victimless crimes like drug abuse, gambling, prostitution etc. so </i><br>
<i>	&gt;that the police and justice system could focus all their manpower on </i><br>
<i>	&gt;the real crimes </i><br>
	     <br>
<p>
Your technique would be particularly effective against real crimes like <br>
slander, I'll bet close to 100% would retract their statement and apologize <br>
to the state for any embarrassment caused.   <br>
	     <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;society as a whole would have to be re-educated (through the  usual </i><br>
<i>	&gt;channels like CNN, tabloids, soaps &amp; movies) to condemn only really </i><br>
<i>	&gt;damaging behaviour instead of harmless recreation.</i><br>
	     <br>
<p>
It's amazing how easy it reach a consensus and educate reporters and authors,  <br>
all you need is a sturdy pair of pliers.<br>
