  It looks like many of such problems would be resolved if you had a smarter<br>
mail server.  You could just tell it what type of client you use, and it<br>
would filter out HTML code, or do any other conversion.<br>
Modems can do such things already, they can talk down to older modems with<br>
simple protocols, when it's needed, but when they figure out they talk to<br>
a peer, they use different protocols and more complex features.<br>
That's called "feature negotiation".  There can also be negotiation of<br>
content, presentation, etc.  I am sure it will be done in due time, there<br>
is enough commercial pressure there - would go much faster and smoother if<br>
driven by clear vision, but it will be done anyway.  Older standards get<br>
extended, than put on the side, then abandoned.  This has happened in<br>
all communication media.<br>
<p>
  As for markup,  I would eventually like to see not just presentation<br>
markup, but semantic marks and comments that can be used to aid translation<br>
of the text or communicated with intelligent user clients.<br>
We'll have a lot more code to filter out.<br>
