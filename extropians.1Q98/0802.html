Hi!<br>

Is this true? I once received an e-mail talking about this "mice without<br>
telomerase" but I never had a change to confirm it.<br>

True, I mention this in my site. The major problem is the brain. If<br>
neurons do age independant of the glial cells, we have a big problem.<br>
Even if they don't, glial cells would have to be "replaced" very<br>
quickly, if things get out of control in the skin, we have some chances<br>
of controling it again, in the brain we're dead. Also, this "cellular<br>
proliferation theory" must be done very fast. "Corrected" cells might<br>
spread in the body, but it's not an instantaneous process, it takes<br>
time, during that time normal cells are losing activity but still are<br>
alive in the body preventing the "immortal" cells from spreading. If we<br>
don't make a good amount -- I don't know how many, but certainly a lot<br>
more than we're doing now with gene therapy -- of cells immortal, we<br>
might see our heart stop because only 1/3 of the cells are active!<br>
(actually muscle cells are also post-mitotic, so what I'm saying is<br>
impossible, but you get the idea)<br>
<p>
See ya,<br>
