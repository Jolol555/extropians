(I've been tearing my few remaining hairs out over this all week, my near-<br>
terminal Male Answer Syndrome inflamed by the prospect of having to admit I<br>
was wrong about the U.S.' endorsement of the UNOST.  Well, I thought I was<br>
wrong once, but fortunately I was mistaken on that occasion :-)<br>

A narrative regarding the UNOST can be found at the U.S. Arms Control and<br>

	On June 16, 1966, both the United States and the Soviet <br>
	Union submitted draft treaties. The U.S. draft dealt only <br>
	with celestial bodies; the Soviet draft covered the whole <br>
	outer space environment. The United States accepted the <br>
	Soviet position on the scope of the Treaty, and by <br>
	September agreement had been reached in discussions at <br>
	Geneva on most Treaty provisions.<br>
<p>
	Differences on the few remaining issues -- chiefly involving <br>
	access to facilities on celestial bodies, reporting on space <br>
	activities, and the use of military equipment and personnel <br>
	in space exploration -- were satisfactorily resolved in private <br>
	consultations during the General Assembly session by December.<br>
<p>
	On the 19th of that month the General Assembly approved <br>
	by acclamation a resolution commending the Treaty. It was <br>
	opened for signature at Washington, London, and Moscow <br>
	on January 27, 1967. On April 25 the Senate gave unanimous <br>
	consent to its ratification, and the Treaty entered into force <br>
	on October 10, 1967.<br>
<p>
The official U.S. text of the treaty, including verification of Senate<br>
ratification can be found at:<br>

Now that we have THAT cleared up, the timing of this discussion couldn't be<br>
more apt, with the announcement by the Lunar Prospector team this week of<br>
confirmation of ice deposits at the moon's poles.  Although most on this list<br>
would probably agree that asteroid resources will be more important in the<br>
long-term, the lunar ice deposits may well be the most valuable<br>
extraterrestrial real estate in the near term.  <br>
<p>
I'm sure all of the spacegeeks on the list like me have been busily designing<br>
ice extractors since the announcement.  An automated system for extracting and<br>
caching lunar ice is well within the means of current technology: I envision a<br>
simple wheeled rover with a front-loader attachment that feeds an automated<br>
oven/still for boiling off the H2O.  Inflatable storage devices would do until<br>
something more stout could be installed.  Even at the 1% concentrations the LP<br>
team is talking about, thousands of gallons could be extracted and stored in<br>
fairly short order.  Automated tankers could haul the water to sites of<br>
greater interest than the cold, dark poles, such as a farside radio telescope<br>
installation or a nearside regolith mining facility.<br>
<p>
A real problem with any such projects, though, will be the nuclear nuts'<br>
ravings about plutonium RTGs.  By definition, solar power won't be available<br>
for any of this work, and so RTGs and, for the real work, genuine power<br>
reactors, will be the only viable power sources.  Get ready for another fight<br>
with the nukenuts.<br>
<p>
The first step, though, is staking a claim that would entice investment in the<br>
water mining endeavor.  Assuming the claim regime I mentioned here last<br>
weekend, someone needs to get a lander down to the poles muy pronto.  Although<br>
it's been 22 years since anyone's done a rocket-braked terminal phase lander,<br>
imagine how cheaply and reliably a Surveyor-class lander could be built and<br>
flown with today's control and fabrication technology.  I'd be more than<br>
willing to bet that it could be done for $250 million or thereabouts and in<br>
two years or so.  Such a vehicle would be doing valuable science, since we<br>
need an on-site assay.  If a fire gets lit on such a project in the next<br>
couple of years, we'll know that all the talk about "private space<br>
development" is more than just talk.<br>
