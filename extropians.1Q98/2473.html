<i>&gt;Ian Goddard wrote 3/4/98: &lt;Semantic closure, yes, in that the boundary of</i><br>
<i>&gt;identity is merely a product of semantics, of words, of utility, and as</i><br>
<i>&gt;such is ultimately an illusion.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subjectivity is not an illusion, it is very real. It is not the product of</i><br>
<i>&gt;semantics, it precedes semantics and has a physical coherent structure.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: I was talking about semantics. The subjective, <br>
  seen as the view of a part, is a part relative to <br>
  the whole; or the subjective is itself relative to <br>
  the objective; thus the concept of the subjective<br>
  contains the concept of the objective, if not, we<br>
  would have nothing to contrast it to in order to<br>
  define what the subjective is. A = (A,~A).<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;We become so attached to our categories, they become more real than the</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality we impose them upon, to a large extent because the mind IS the</i><br>
<i>&gt;process of categorizing and thus IS those categories.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They often apparently become more real than reality, but they don't really</i><br>
<i>&gt;become more real than reality because concepts are an integral part of</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality. A concept is reality identifying itself for the purpose of</i><br>
<i>&gt;altering reality. The mind is not a collection of categories only, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;open at all times to all of external reality and all of consensual reality</i><br>
<i>&gt;prior to categorization, a holistic openness. Categorization occurs after</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest imposes itself on those realities. Interest comes from within</i><br>
<i>&gt;subjectivity, precedes categories and is unique to each separate person. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Each separate person can and does set themselves against the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;separate remainder of the universe. Yet they are connected.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: We can define concepts as real or unreal, <br>
  either way, concept A is A relative to ~A.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;To see that which lies beyond the mind, its words and categories, is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;see the truth.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;So even the most sharply defined category confirms holistic identity, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;thus holistic identity is always true, and atomism is never true, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;always assumed, always semantics.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think the opposite, atomism points to the true, holism points to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;good, and the conjunction of holism and atomism points to the beautiful.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Why does atomism point to the true? <br>
<p>
  What is "the good."<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;It's probable that because holism is always true, and thus there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;not-holism, that that is exactly why holism is nearly impossible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;grasp...&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Holism is nearly impossible to grasp because it is essentially a spatial</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept, infinitely divisible, and our separate subjective selves are</i><br>
<i>&gt;finite and indivisible, a mere one-dimensional point in space. How can the</i><br>
<i>&gt;finite grasp the infinite other than through semantics, a poor substitute?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
  IAN: Atomism is also a spacial concept, just like<br>
  holism. When we think of a point in space, we also<br>
  have to be thinking of space, relative to which the <br>
  point is a point in space. So that's why there really<br>
  is never deviation from holism, for atomism implies<br>
  and rests upon holism. Only holism is always real.<br>
  Atomism is an idea unaware of its true nature. <br>
