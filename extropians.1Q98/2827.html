That would be almost irrelevant.  The kind of people who follow Falwell<br>
don't think for themselves.  A teen mother who is told that her child<br>
will be taken away (for the good of both of them, of course) probably<br>
won't argue.  She's already way too stressed, young, impressionable,<br>
and willing to bow to authority.<br>

<p>
In my particular case, he was out of the scene before I was born, so I've<br>
never met him, never will, and never missed him.  I've never wished I'd<br>
had a father, although intellectually I wonder what it would have been<br>
like, or how things may have been different.  For example, I may have<br>
developed self-confidence sooner than I did, but now I'm none the worse<br>
for wear.<br>

<p>
Indeed.  I would not be surprised if prisons had *slightly* more single-<br>
parent kids than not, but the original message made it sound like it was<br>
a vast majority.  I won't believe that without proof.  And as you<br>
point out, it probably depends precisely on the circumstances.  A messy<br>
divorce may screw up a child alot more than a child (like me) who's never<br>
had any experience with a second parent.<br>
