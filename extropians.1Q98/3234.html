Good point Anders. I was wondering about this very issue months ago. I<br>
would hope that the number of emails would slow down a bit too if there<br>
weren't so many tangents being explored here..<br>
<p>
There are so many intelligent people on this list who are fascinated by<br>
what others on the list think about a wide variety of topics and it<br>
becomes very easy to slip away into socio/political issues which might not<br>
directly relate to posthumanism.<br>
<p>
Sorry if I contaminated the stream. (-;<br>
<p>
I am working on a posthuman project right now. Its a conceptual animation<br>
in a kind of music video format. I'm still interested in getting my mind<br>
around a body of work which documented the constituent parts of the human<br>
body broken down into a list. I'd love to know if ANYONE out there knows<br>
what I'm talking about and might give me a lead.<br>
<p>
When I'm done with the video I'll put some stills on a web site for your<br>
inspection.<br>
<p>
Thanks for listening to me babble on once again...<br>
