<p>
Food, housing, education and 1st-class medical care available for all<br>
citizens. I call that a _very_ positive (but non-economic) side effect.<br>
<p>
The primary reason I posted was to correct the (IMO), false, statement that<br>
welfare systems cause weak economies (look at various European economies<br>
and you'll see it's  bit more complex than that). My knowledge of economy<br>
is inadequate to 'prove' that welfare systems are economically sound, I<br>
just feel that the material cost of welfare to me is well worth the<br>
increased quality of life for others and from what I see around me on this<br>
continent about 300 million people seem to agree more or less (libertarian<br>
parties are even more insignificant here that in the US).<br>
<p>
I do not (any longer ;-) expect to convince many people on this list about<br>
such things so y'all just do some state-bashing if you want but stick to<br>
the facts (Fact: It is possible to have a healty, growing, high-tech,<br>
efficient, knowledge &amp; services-based economy and an extensive<br>
social-security system).<br>
