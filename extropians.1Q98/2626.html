<i>&gt; From:          Anton Sherwood &lt;dasher@netcom.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then I withdraw the fanciful metaphor.  My first draft put it this way:</i><br>
<i>&gt; You said that if Mrs O'Connor had had an abortion then our Max,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not a "precursor" of miscellaneous tissue, would have been murdered.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But if Mr &amp; Mrs O'Connor had used effective contraception, Max More </i><br>
<i>&gt; would be just as absent from our world.  Would that be any less murder?</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Every sperm is sacred..."</i><br>
<p>
Um, no.  A single ejaculation involves perhaps millions of sperm, and <br>
in the extremely unusual case as many as three of them might survive <br>
to adulthood.<br>
<p>
Obviously God has a rather lower opinion of sperm than to deem them <br>
"sacred".<br>
<p>
Ova, on the other hand, perhaps as many as a third could survive to <br>
adulthood.  God obviously has a higher opinion of ova than of sperm, <br>
and we don't want to argue with God, do we?  So we should prohibit <br>
female virginity, or even sexual abstinence by females.<br>
<p>
  (removing tongue from cheek)<br>
<p>
  (on second thought, putting it back for a second)<br>
<p>
Remember, if God wanted us to go naked, we'd be born that way.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; &gt; [...]  In Oregon, the logic of the statist establishment of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; death-worshipping as the official religion means that my tax dollars are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; now being reallocated to the poor so they can pay a doctor to murder them</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on demand.  I am soiled by this [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  48% of Oregon voters, including me, voted against doctor-assisted suicide,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; aka, licensing doctors to murder.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree that making you pay for it is intolerably cruel.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But it's absurd to call it murder when done at the victim's request.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; [...] the core ethics of Western Civilization that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; worked well for centuries on end, namely, humans are not to be used as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; means because they are ends in themselves.  [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I dunno about you, but I use other humans as means every day: </i><br>
<i>&gt; I call it trade.</i><br>
