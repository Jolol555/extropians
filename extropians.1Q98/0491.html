Beleive what? That  a person should have to demonstrate a minimum fiscal<br>
capacity before being allowed to reproduce? While one could say this is an<br>
unreasonable imposition on the individuals rights to procreate, I say that<br>
my being forced by government, society, and my own concience, to support the<br>
abandoned products of irresponsible reproduction is an unreasonable<br>
impostion on my privacy, my personal productivity, and my rights to enjoy<br>
the fruits of that productivity. My being forced to pay for not only the<br>
irresponsible reproduction, but to pay an incompetent government bureaucracy<br>
to raise these children in such a negligent manner is also being forced to<br>
be an accessory to child neglect and abuse, while my own ability to properly<br>
support and demonstrate a fiscal ability to properly raise my own offspring<br>
is infringed upon. Pick someone elses pocket, buddy!!<br>
