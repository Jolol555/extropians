I probably heard the same quote by Richard Seed<br>
(aired on NPR), and I think what Seed said was pretty<br>
unusual in ways... If his intent was to throw out a<br>
few comforting words to religious people to minimize<br>
the flack from them, he failed, as what he said will<br>
enrage the Christian fundamentalists.<br>
<p>
Sure, he starts out pretty conventionally<br>
(religion-wise):<br>
<p>
(from my memory) "God created man in his image..."<br>
<p>
but then he goes off on an unusual tangent:<br>
<p>
(I paraphrase from memory) "and it is inevitable that<br>
we will eventually achieve god-like powers and become<br>
practically like gods. So, these scientific advances<br>
are in line with God's will..."<br>
<p>
Be aware that you can confirm the accuracy (or lack<br>
therof) of my paraphrase by hearing his exact words<br>
in RealAudio format at NPR's Web site at<br>
<p>

No, Christian Fundamentalist will not be soothed by<br>
this statement. It is very much against their way of<br>
thinking, which stresses the flawed nature of<br>
humanity and the need for God to redeem it. Seed's<br>
statement is almost extropian, except for the implied<br>
existance of God.<br>
<p>
(Can a person believe in God and still be effectively<br>
extropian? I would say, "Yes, provided that he/she<br>
accepted that their belief was unproven and<br>
unfalsifiable, and therefore outside the realm of<br>
science and rationality." Such a person might act in<br>
an extropian manner in all ways that matter to<br>
extropians. Perhaps, in light of studies (which may<br>
have been poorly conducted) that belief in God is<br>
good for a person's health and longevity, the person<br>
merely chose to carry the God meme for his/her own<br>
extropian benefit, although some might consider this<br>
quite a mental juggling act. How is it spelled,<br>
"Deism"?)<br>
