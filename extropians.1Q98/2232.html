<p>
Perhaps my geographic location near the buckle of the Bible Belt informs my<br>
view too much, but I see real threats to the developments of enhancements.  I<br>
often experience a sense of dread when I contrast the world-views of my<br>
friends living on the West Coast or northern Europe, almost completely<br>
surrounded by a social circle of skeptical, scientifically-minded people, with<br>
the expressions of opinion I see as the near-universal cultural milieu<br>
elsewhere in the world.  Transhumans are a tiny minority among scientific<br>
humanists, who themselves comprise a tiny minority of the human race.  Of<br>
course scientific humanism has had an impact on the world out of all<br>
proportion to the numbers of people who have really grasped the scientific<br>
revolution and have internalized its values, but the I FEEL that the<br>
possibility is very real that all we have achieved in the last 500 years<br>
stands threatened to be inundated by the ocean of irrational superstition and<br>
primitive values governing the minds of the billions of humans who make up the<br>
vast majority of the human race.<br>
<p>
What evidence of this is there, you ask, Damien?  The current ban on human<br>
cloning is only the most recent.  Galileo's suppression by the Inquisition is<br>
perhaps the most famous.  In between there are many, many more examples.  You<br>
argue that the self-evident economic benefit of real enhancements will<br>
overcome the ideological opposition that is only now forming as the great mass<br>
of people come dimly to be aware of the possibility of radically transforming<br>
the human condition.  And of course Galileo's work was not suppressed for<br>
long.  By expressing the new knowledge in terms more palatable to the current<br>
world view, pioneers have insinuated their revolutionary insights into the<br>
mainstream to slowly subvert old ways.<br>
<p>
But the very realization of the truly fundamental change that lies just ahead<br>
that has given birth to a uniquely transhuman or extropian world-view will<br>
eventually dawn in the minds of the majority. When it does, we shouldn't<br>
expect a grudging accommodation.  Get too close to the core and you provoke<br>
coercion and violence.  People with too deep a stake in the old order react<br>
very badly indeed to unavoidable challenges to that order: They bomb abortion<br>
clinics (in contemporary America) and pass laws against the free formation of<br>
capital (in late feudal Europe); they invoke the mandate of god against<br>
contraception (in Latin America today) and send writers of seditious<br>
literature to the gulag (in Soviet Russia); and they do ban the use of<br>
threatening technologies (the Ming prohibition on construction of deep-water<br>
vessels; the Japanese cultural prohibition on firearms technology following<br>
the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate).  Occasionally, they launch wars<br>
of annihilation against their memetic adversaries (jihads and crusades).<br>
<p>
At some point in the not-too-distant future, the ideas we have been discussing<br>
here for the last few years will become known to the larger world.  People<br>
like Eric Drexler and Max More and Damien Broderick and Ed Regis are doing<br>
their best to see that that happens, for better or worse.  (For better, I<br>
happen to think.)  The idea of creation of "post-biological man" (as the term<br>
was uttered in hushed tones in _Virtual Obsession_) will become a commonplace<br>
in popular culture.  When that happens, buckle your seat belt, for a I fear we<br>
are in for a bumpy ride, at least, and probably some severe turbulence.  Let<br>
us hope that it is no worse than that.<br>
