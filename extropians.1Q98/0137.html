<i>&gt; I came up with this, regarding a stroke.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as I know you get blood between the skull and</i><br>
<i>&gt; your brain. The presure will damage your brain !</i><br>
<i>&gt; (please correct me if I'm wrong)</i><br>
<p>
No, that is a epi- or subdural hematoma, strokes occur when a blood<br>
vessel bursts or is clogged in the brain. <br>
<p>
These hematomas is something we ought to be aware of, they are a real<br>
danger to those of us who live active lives with a risk for bumping<br>
our heads or getting hit. What happens is that one of the arteries<br>
outside the dura (in epidural hematomas) bursts, and blood starts to<br>
accumulate. Usually the victims doesn't notice anything at first, and<br>
just think they got a minor concussion. But after a while (half an<br>
hour, sometimes more) they get dizzy, feel weak, faint and gradually<br>
descend into a coma. Death results if the pressure is not<br>
lowered. Fortunately this is not that hard to do, to quote my teacher<br>
in medical technology "Just use a drill. A Black &amp; Decker will do in<br>
an emergency" (yes, he was an intensive care surgeon :-).<br>
<p>
The subdural hematomas are more treacherous. They occur mainly in old<br>
people, and the blood accumulates beneath the dura. Since they usually<br>
occur in very old people lying in geriatric wards, often with<br>
Alzheimer's disease, and are fairly slow they are often not noticed<br>
before it is too late.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, what if we make hole's in the skull upfront, with some </i><br>
<i>&gt; "valve's" that act only when the presure inside is too high ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aside from the funny things sticking out of your head,</i><br>
<i>&gt; what do you think of it ?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think it is necessary as long as you have somebody with<br>
medical experience and a drill around. The main problem is that<br>
inserting the valves is a noticeable risk in itself, and could lead to<br>
meningitis (and that is bad news for us who want to keep our brains<br>
nice and shiny) even if they do not cross the skin (any implants that<br>
cross the skin become probable sites for infections). There is also<br>
the problem of cells growing into the valve and blocking it.  Another<br>
idea I have had to deal with the hematomas was to replace parts of the<br>
arteries with more flexible silicon, but it seems to increase the risk<br>
for trombosis. To be honest, the body is an awful mess when you try to<br>
improve it.<br>
<p>
Let's get back to strokes, since they are a real danger. It is the<br>
third leading cause of death in the United States, and the number one<br>
cause of adult disability. It occurs if a blood vessel is clogged by<br>
an embolism or if it bursts, so it can be prevented by keeping the<br>
cardiovascular system clean and supple. Risk factors include: age over<br>
55, high blood pressure, heart disease (esp. atrial fibrillation),<br>
diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, family history of strokes,<br>
obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and lack of<br>
exercise. Fortunately, most of these can be fixed and could be<br>
counteracted by a transhuman lifestyle.<br>
<p>
If stroke occurs (common symptoms: one-sided weakness, numbness or<br>
paralysis, sudden blurred or decreased vision on one or both sides,<br>
difficulties speaking or understanding simple statements, dizziness<br>
and loss of balance combined with other symptoms, sudden severe<br>
unexplainable headache), one should immediatelly get in touch with a<br>
hospital, every minute counts since the ischemic part of the brain<br>
will die within minutes, and the chemicals released from this will<br>
damage cells in surrounding areas. By quickly injecting<br>
anti-coagulants or chemicals that will dissolve blood clots it may be<br>
possible to deal with some strokes (on the other hand, if the stroke<br>
is due to a burst artery this will make matters worse), and there is<br>
appearing anti-ischemic drugs that lessen the effects of ischemia. But<br>
the damage has been done.<br>
