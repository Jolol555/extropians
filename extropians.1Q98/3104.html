This sounds interesting... anybody heard about it before?<br>
<p>
(it's actually a little bit "off-topic" from the subject...)<br>
<p>
later,<br>

I would like to approach this discussion from the direction of<br>
facilitating the brain to re-establish a more homeostatic state using<br>
EEG biofeedback (neurofeedback).  To the extent that drugs or trauma<br>
have induced a pattern of persistent dysregulation, I regularly see the<br>
re-regulation of brain activity, remediation of pathology - both psycho<br>
and neuro, and a sometimes dramatic increase in cognitive functioning<br>
superior to premorbid levels using neurofeedback.  <br>
<p>
	In this "treatment" the client's EEG is displayed to the client in the<br>
form of a computer game in real time.  Certain "signatures" of<br>
pathology, obtainable in QEEG, usually show a distribution of excess<br>
fast or slow wave activity in various regions.  EEG sensors are placed<br>
over these areas and the client is asked to either upregulate the slow<br>
activity or downregulate the fast activity using a clinical<br>
neurofeedback system and protocols now well established.  Results are<br>
often rapid (5-20 sessions) and dramatic.  In the 3 1/2 years of doing<br>
this work I take a Darwinian view of the progress I see.  Once the brain<br>
sees itself working, is in a loop with itself, it merely "drops out"<br>
anything that is in the way of its augmented function.  That includes<br>
things like depression, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit<br>
hyperactivity disorder, traumatic brain injury, post-stroke syndrome,<br>
and other enduring problems for which allopathic approaches have readily<br>
observable limits. <br>
<p>
	The continuum of effect stretches from pathology remediation, to<br>
greater balance, flexibility and placticity in the nervous system, to<br>
elicitation of peak performance zones (astronauts, athletes, and<br>
performers do EEG work), to profound transpersonal/kundalini<br>
experiences.  This is all through inner work.  Nothing is induced<br>
through the sensors, though some systems work with visually pulsed light<br>
to entrain certain effects.  However, like other exogenous methods, it<br>
can show you the territory but it can't get you there.  The<br>
straightforward EEG work, however does get people to improved<br>
functioning which, in most cases appears to persist after treatment. <br>
<p>
	I would recommend this as a non-invasive approach to the problem of<br>
HPPD, and as an interesting self-regulation technique in the<br>
armamentarium of propelling onself forward in ways that this particular<br>
vehicle is uniquely tuned to experience.  Further information can be had<br>
at the sites: www.eegspectrum.com and www.ssnr.com. <br>
