Doug Bailey offers, among his several cogent (if not ultimately convincing)<br>
criticisms of matters Extropian:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What substance is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the act of coining a term for a concept that someone else</i><br>
<i>&gt;created?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Don't get me wrong, coining terms is great idea since it can</i><br>
<i>&gt;help to improve commmunication.  Take a concept that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;otherwise take a sentence or two to trigger the reader's</i><br>
<i>&gt;mind and encapsulate it in a word.  But I see a lot of people</i><br>
<i>&gt;patting themselves on the back for simply coining a term.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose that if anyone merits criticism for crowing over coining "Ex-"<br>
words, I do, since I claim to have coined "Extropy" as we use the term.  (I<br>
freely admit that others independently combined the same letters and applied<br>
them to other subjects.)  Maybe other people would draw similar blame for<br>
similar "Ex-" coinages.<br>
<p>
But whatever the merits of *that* criticism, I'll wager that it does not<br>
really hit the target at which Doug aims.  After all, people associated with<br>
ExI just simply do not waste a lot of time dwelling on who thought up which<br>
words.  They document coinages, to some degree, and set the issue aside.<br>
<p>
I think that Doug really aims to criticize Extropians for not contributing any<br>
*substance* to transhumanist thought; that is, for doing *nothing more* than<br>
thinking up new words.  If that is the criticism, we have something<br>
interesting to discuss.<br>
<p>
My short response:  Extropians have in fact often credited FM-2030 and others<br>
of their intellectual forebears, so I do not think they can credibly be blamed<br>
for stealing others' thunder.  Furthermore, they have updated and fleshed out<br>
themes only hinted at in earlier works, so I do not think it proper to blame<br>
them for failing to add to the genre.  Also, I believe that on several fronts<br>
Extropians have generated genuinely unique ideas (such developing a distinctly<br>
libertarian flavor of transhumanism) or at a minimum been first to put<br>
familiar ideas (such as spontaneous ordering) in a transhumanist context.<br>
