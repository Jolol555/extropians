Because the idea that Martians like to make statues just like us is idiocy. <br>
Because the idea that Martians have faces just like us is idiocy. <br>
Because such Martians would be unimaginative and dull as dishwater.<br>

Humans are very good at finding patterns, even when they're no there, <br>
just look at any cloud formation.<br>

You're probably tired of hearing this but it's true nevertheless, <br>
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Completely revising your <br>
world view and throwing out theories that have worked well for years needs to <br>
be done from time to time, but it's not something that should be undertaken<br>
lightly. You had better be very, very certain that it's necessary and not <br>
just the result of something much simpler, like a silly mistake or fraud or <br>
idiocy. If you start making major revisions in your basic theories about how <br>
the world works for trivial reason, very soon you will find that you've made<br>
negative progress and your world view will become very confused.<br>
<p>
There is nothing very esoteric in all this, we use this principle in daily <br>
life. If I tell you I just saw a green car drive down the street you'll <br>
probably believe me, if I tell you I just saw a green giraffe walk down the <br>
street with the Pope on it's back singing "Louie Louie" you will probably <br>
demand better evidence than just my word before you believe me.<br>
<p>
It's good to have an open mind, but not so open all your brains fall out.<br>
