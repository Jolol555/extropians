&lt; Ah, the beauty of the analog!  How I weary of this<br>
digital age, where half of reality is sampled out of<br>
existence, and with algorithms and compression<br>
techniques, more than half.  What a paucity!  How<br>
threadbare! &gt;<br>
<p>
and James Rogers wrote 3/3/98 (and Mr. Kamphuis<br>
chimed in on the same point):<br>
&lt;What 50% are digital systems missing?  Digital<br>
systems have the same resolution/perception<br>
capability as analog systems within the limits of the<br>
noise floor (which affects analog systems as well). <br>
There is nothing analog that can not be represented<br>
digitally within the limits of the analog system. <br>
There are well known methods for reading and storing<br>
arbitrary precision analog values with digital<br>
devices as primitive as a 1-bit signal converters.&gt;<br>
<p>
Subsequently, this thread pretty much turned into a<br>
discussion of electronics (with the exception of John<br>
K Clark claiming that all implementations can be<br>
boiled down to digital codes or signals; perhaps, but<br>
I don't think that means their execution or<br>
interpretation would necessarily be 'digital' ). <br>
<p>
I happened to stumble onto a post from 970514 in the<br>
Psyche-D archives by biophysicist Peter Cariani that,<br>
I think, is more in line with what Reilly had in mind<br>
in positing analog vs digital<br>
(<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/psyche-list/1530.html">http://www.ai.sri.com/~connolly/psyche-list/1530.html</a>)<br>
<p>
Cariani discusses "what characterizes a measurement<br>
and what characterizes a computation", responding to<br>
Neil Rickert's claims that "computation is the<br>
process of transforming one representation into<br>
another ... But analog to digital conversion is<br>
measurement". Cariani responds that "it's much more<br>
difficult and problematic than it first seems" and<br>
launches into a discussion of Robert Rosen's "formal<br>
framework for talking about models and their relation<br>
to the material world". <br>
<p>
Cariani lists four types of transformation: symbolic<br>
computation, symbolic measurement, nonsymbolic<br>
effecting, and nonsymbolic transduction; and adds:<br>
"It's a semiotic framework that very well describes<br>
the structure of scientific models ... The prediction<br>
derived from the first measurement should match the<br>
observed outcome of the second measurement, or as<br>
Hertz put it, 'the image of the consequent'<br>
corresponds to the 'consequent of the image'<br>
(commutation)".<br>
<p>
Cariani sites a passage from John von Neumann (1948,<br>
titled "The Role of the Digital Procedure in Reducing<br>
the Noise Level") to assert that "analog and digital<br>
systems have different strengths and weaknesses" and<br>
points out that "calling it all 'computation' ...<br>
runs roughshod over the analog-digital distinction".<br>
Cariani explains: "Digital systems are useful for<br>
high degrees of reliability and combinatoric<br>
multiplication of states; analog systems are useful<br>
for retaining the richness of perceptual inputs, in<br>
keeping around all those aspects of the sensed world<br>
that might not be readily relevant, but which could<br>
become so".<br>
<p>
Cariani concludes his discussion by warning that "the<br>
whole notion of 'computation' becomes meaningless<br>
when everything becomes a computation" because: "Once<br>
you conflate the analog and the digital ... there is<br>
then no distinction left between a formal procedure,<br>
a sensing operation, an effecting operation, and some<br>
noninformational process, like digestion". <br>
<p>
I conclude that a cognitive science for intelligent<br>
technologies needs such a biosemiotic framework if it<br>
is to keep from wandering in hermeneutical circles!<br>
<p>
I also want to conlude this blurb by tying it back to<br>
Reilly Jones' recent Extropians prophecies about "The<br>
Culture Of Death". Make no mistake, the way Reilly<br>
presents it, this is an organized conspiracy of<br>
compost-modernist philosophers and a parasitical<br>
political-entertainment class that wants, as a<br>
radical group from the 70s (The Last Poets) once put<br>
it, to implement a Global-Brain regulatory regime<br>
where "automatic, push-button, remote-control,<br>
synthetic genetics commands your soul", a<br>
deterministic hedonism that erases the distinction<br>
between life &amp; death... <br>
<p>
Well, in a pluralistic universe there are always<br>
going to be conflicting forces making contrary<br>
predictions about the results of some<br>
less-than-perfect epistemological approach. It seems,<br>
to me, simplistic and even dualistic, to see the<br>
current situation as some eschatological Armageddon<br>
between supposedly 'organized' forces of Good and<br>
Evil. I see, not an abstract population being drawn<br>
and quartered by polarities but, instead, a<br>
*natural-historic* host of individuals enacting this<br>
drama under some 'global laws', but mostly 'local<br>
rules', autopoietically self-maintaining the<br>
potentialities in an unpredictable but robust and<br>
ongoing, middle-out way (also known as the Tao).<br>
