Hi all,<br>

Yes, that's the question. If the fetus acquires human rights, we can't  <br>
abort him, because he have fatal defects or will come to birth even in  <br>
these instances. If we justified an abortion even in these instances, we  <br>
are murders of human beings and justified a selection of humans to kill  <br>
handicapped people.<br>
<p>
I think, a fetus isn't a human being with a free will; it's a part of the  <br>
mother in his first 0 to 100 or 180 days. A fetus is a being with the  <br>
potential to be an human being with human right(s) in the future.<br>

<i>&gt; I think that just about ends the discussion, don't you?</i><br>
<p>
I think that people who think in that way don't really know the holocaust.  <br>
They belittle and play down the holocaust; the jews in Nazi germany have  <br>
hadn't teoretical human rights like the fetus. Jews i Nazi germany have  <br>
had human rights like other human beings and the Nazis *have denied* this<br>
human rights. A fetus is only for a small group of foe of abortions a  <br>
human being.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
