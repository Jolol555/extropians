By that argument, anything that is must be great.  And stupidity is quite<br>
pervasive, so it must be  "if not beneficial, then at least a functiona[sic],<br>
rugged, and competitive concept".:)<br>

A better question would be: when have governments ever not "become<br>
bloated, inefficient, and counterproductive monsters that are resented<br>
by many of their citizens"?  It might just be the nature of the beast<br>
rather bad people that makes government do this.  If this is so, then<br>
we must either kill the beast (the anarchist solution) or put it on a tight<br>
leash (the minarchist ditto).  To dream that if only your team was in<br>
power and all the good that would do is only to repeat the last few<br>
millenia of reform and revolution.<br>
<p>
Also, the big difference between government and markets is that the<br>
former uses force, the latter persuasion.  Whenever one proposes<br>
to use the government to do anything, one is supporting the use<br>
of force to achieve that end -- which generally means one is<br>
assuming persuasion would not work.  Now, would a posthuman<br>
or even a mere transhuman need to use force?<br>
<p>
Frankly, I don't think this list is a good place for this debate.<br>
