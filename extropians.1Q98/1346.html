In a message dated 98-01-31 13:42:04 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; Primate canines are apparently primarily for male-male sexual dominance<br>
<i> &gt; displays.  The size of canines in primate is very closely correlated with</i><br>
<i> &gt; how often males fight for females.  Monogamous species have small canines</i><br>
<i> &gt; and harem species have big ones.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; But, yes, many primates eat mostly fruit, including some putative</i><br>
ancestors,<br>
<i> &gt; and I think it is reflected in the teeth somehow.</i><br>
 <br>
 Yet the chimpanzee, contrary to the claims of liberally blindered<br>
researchers,<br>
 have been shown to prefer meat as a food source. Even Dr. Goodall has<br>
confirmed<br>
 this. Since chimps are our closest existing relatives, I think that what some<br>
 fruit sucking lemur does is a little less relevant. Better yet is what<br>
 paleontologists find out about our ancestors like Home Heidelbergensis, Homo<br>
 Antecessor,, or Proto-Homo Sapiens preferred for a diet.<br>

i dont think thats correct, they have a primarily vegetative diet, and
sometimes they'll go on insane missions and kill other primates and eat them,
sometimes their own kind, and they eat it raw, brains and all.
