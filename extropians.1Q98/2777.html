Yup -- I forgot that one. But it's not a strategy for dealing with crime; it's<br>
one way of responding after the event. (An ideal strategy for dealing with <br>
crime is one that focusses on preventing crimes being committed, not on<br>
bolting the stable door after the horse has fled.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Firstly, deterrence. This is pretty much disproven as an approach to</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; intelligent person would rationally expect to be caught.</i><br>
 <br>
Yup -- as I think I said.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Arguably this is due to incorrect risk evaluation on the part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; criminally inclined; here in the UK there's a massive program of placing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; CCTV cameras in public places, and it does indeed appear to have a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; impact on petty crime (vandalism, car theft, muggings) in public places</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; overlooked by cameras. The point being that the punishment doesn't deter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; criminals; it's the certainly of capture that deters them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But being caught would be little deterrent, if no punishment </i><br>
<i>&gt; followed.  </i><br>
 <br>
This was also a punishment in the UK in the early 19th century. UK law<br>
at the time was based on something historians know as the Bloody Code.<br>
There were no police, as we know them, but freelance commercial "thief<br>
takers" and various ways by which people might be arrested and come up<br>
before the justices. And if they _were_ arrested and tried, the likely<br>
verdict was Death -- death for everything, for stealing the equivalent<br>
of two loaves of bread. This is obviously a disproportionate response,<br>
and so it became the practice for judges to recommend clemency; it got<br>
to the point where only 20% of people sentenced to hang were actually<br>
hanged, and the process was almost entirely arbitrary.<br>
<p>
England was _extremely_ lawless in those days, by modern standards.<br>
Interestingly, the judicial system focussed on protecting property,<br>
not people: Attempted murder was treated as a minor misdemeanor, but<br>
rape was a crime against property (women being chattel), and rape<br>
in marriage was seen as a contradiction in terms. However, pick-pocketing<br>
was enough to guarantee the law would prescribe a neck-stretching -- <br>
and the humans who administered it would usually prescribe clemency.<br>
<p>
In short, having punishments that are so severe that nobody wants to<br>
enforce them is nearly as bad as no punishment at all. As is<br>
inconsistency. Relatively mild penalties can be enough -- if the risk<br>
of incurring them is seen as a dead certainty by potential criminals.<br>
("If I burgle that house with the open window I _will_ be tracked down<br>
and go to prison for six months ... hmm, I didn't like it there last <br>
time.  Think I'll pass.")<br>
<p>
As for the fairly tiny proportion of dangerous recidivists -- well, I'm<br>
not opposed to the death penalty because it's painful or extreme; I'm<br>
opposed to it because it's irreversible. The British judicial system <br>
has maintained a constant error rate of about 10-12% on murder convictions<br>
throughout the 20th century, as indicated by original verdicts being <br>
struck down. In many cases in the past 20 years, people have been found<br>
to have been wrongly convicted decades after the event. Before the death<br>
penalty was suspended in 1965, the appeals process was abbreviated; if<br>
you were found guilty of murder you would hang within ten weeks. In<br>
contrast, the recidivism rate for murderers in the UK is less than 0.2%;<br>
a life sentence here means a minimum of 14 years, a mean of 22 years,<br>
and lifetime supervision thereafter, with the option of no release<br>
at all for serious cases. So the death penalty in the UK resulted in the<br>
deaths of more innocent people than mandatory life sentences for murder,<br>
as currently enforced. <br>
<p>
Personally, I don't much like paying taxes that support people in<br>
prison, but the alternatives -- letting them free, or killing them --<br>
are worse. Maybe freezing (when proven reversible) would be an<br>
acceptable alternative to execution; it takes dangerous ones out of<br>
circulation permanently, but its reversible if you find there was a<br>
mistake. Certainly I'd be willing to pay taxes towards that -- it'd be<br>
cheaper than prison, and one way of viewing it is that the cost is<br>
insurance against the possibility of miscarriages of justice in capital<br>
cases.<br>
