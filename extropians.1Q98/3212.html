Well, he was just responding to some syncophantic foolishness with equally<br>
foolish statements. However, as the case in Arkansas this week unfolds, as well<br>
as similar cases, it seems that the geeks in this world are starting to put<br>
their feet down and arent' gonna take any more shit from the mundanes of the<br>
world anymore. Species differentiation, at least on a cultural level, may be<br>
begininning. Geeks of the world unite!!!! Put down the oppression of the<br>
beautiful people!!! One disadvantage nerds have is that they are outnumbered by<br>
the morons, however what they lack in numbers they make up for in brains...<br>
