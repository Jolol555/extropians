Anthropic principle. From a (semi)infinite population of universes only<br>
very few create (mostly, puzzled) observers. Homogenous, degenerate states<br>
obviously do not make very good observers. <br>

<i>&gt; of life.  Take a look at figure 5 on <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.sns.ias.edu/~max/toe.html</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; and you see what a tiny fraction of the possible values for physical</i><br>
<i>&gt; constants would allow life as we know it to exist.  One way to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; this seeming coincidence is to say that our universe was intentionally</i><br>
<i>&gt; created to have parameters in this region.</i><br>
<p>
Let's assume that planck quantum foam-spawned universes are<br>
mutation-catastrophe-subthreshold, and that generation of stable ones is<br>
rare. Let's assume we can both boost (by many orders of magnitude) their<br>
generation rate/shift their basic parameters by a) shifting the spectrum<br>
of femtoscopic events into a high-energy scale (lots DIY deity particles<br>
colliding)  b)  make them very special kind of events (special particles,<br>
special energies, special everything). <br>
<p>
Let's say our universe is open (bummer), and that fabrication of new ones<br>
connected with traversable wormholes are impossible here (what a botched<br>
design!). Soon the cosmos is full with superaltruistic supercivs, which<br>
can maximize the generation of optimal, or nearly-optimal universes. At<br>
the cost of their reduced lifetime: Good Gardening is incompatible with a<br>
long life. If the supercivs are not homogenous, this would seem to make<br>
for lots of dilemmas. (Why, the idiot altruist next door senselessly<br>
wastes his resources! [lots of incomprehensible activities] That one has<br>
teached him.)<br>
<p>
Would you do such a thing, making the metacosmos a (much) better place to<br>
live, at _your_ costs? <br>
<p>
Gods'R'Us? Or Devils'R'Us?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Note that this does not explain where the universe creator came from.</i><br>
<p>
I think such questions are meaningless in a fluctuating multiverse, for<br>
they are rooted in beliefs of monkeys with an euclidian spacetime habitat. <br>
A pseudoproblem, like hen &amp; egg precedence, or looking for edges in a<br>
hypertoroidal spacetime. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is possible that the universe in which he lives is fundamentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; different from our own in ways we can't currently imagine, and is such</i><br>
<i>&gt; that life can exist automatically.  He then created our universe to</i><br>
<i>&gt; explore the possibility of how our kind of life would work, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; only possible within this narrow and special range (an advanced version</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the way we play with different rules for cellular automata, and find</i><br>
<i>&gt; that only a limited set of rules lead to interesting behavior).</i><br>
<p>
As Moravec has argued, usurping God would require quite a collaboration on<br>
his part. This may be different if our metalevel is sufficient high, and<br>
not isolated as e.g. Ray's networked Tierra is. One hypothetical path to<br>
Singularity is (spontaneous, or induced) complexity explosion of agents in<br>
future network matrix. Maybe we _should_ be looking for a bug in the<br>
metalevel (notice that many systems, as cellular automata, can be<br>
implemented to be provably uncrashable). What's the particle physicist's<br>
equivalent of crashme, and would it be a wise thing to try?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Of course there are alternate explanations for this coincidence.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; may be that all possible universes exist, and only those for which the</i><br>
<i>&gt; constants are such as to allow the formation of life do have life form.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But that is not a much simpler theory than the one which says that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we were formed out of another universe; both require the existence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; universes that we otherwise have no evidence for.</i><br>
