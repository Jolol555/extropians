    LONDON (AFX) - PPL Therapeutics PLC shares were sharply higher after it<br>
announced it has successfully cloned a calf.<br>
    At 9:56 AM, PPL shares were up 12-1/2 pence at 192-1/2 after the company<br>
said its U.S. operation had produced 'Mr Jefferson', a healthy 98-pound<br>
Holstein.<br>
    Analysts said the birth of Mr Jefferson will help quell some<br>
reservations in<br>
the scientific community about the company's earlier success in cloning<br>
sheep. <br>
    Other researchers have not been able to reproduce the success of PPL<br>
and its<br>
associated scientists at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, and some doubts had<br>
been<br>
raised about the veracity of the cloning claims.<br>
    PPL had produced Dolly, the first cloned sheep, and Polly, the first<br>
cloned<br>
transgenic sheep. <br>
    PPL specialises in the production of human proteins in the milk of<br>
transgenic sheep -- animals which have had human DNA incorporated into their<br>
DNA. <br>
    The company has said that cloning could represent a more cost-effective<br>
way<br>
of producing transgenic animals. Animals said cloned cows could provide<br>
greater<br>
production volume for the human proteins, which the company is developing for<br>
the treatment of haemophilia and cystic fibrosis.<br>
