Er ... to cross-fertilize with the Linux thread, I think you've just <br>
invented the seeds of the Free Hardware Foundation, which will be<br>
dedicated to providing robust, GNU Copylefted blueprints for all the<br>
tools and durables required for everyday life without dependency on<br>
nasty proprietary icky private patented software.<br>
<p>
I can just see where (by analogy with the free software movement)<br>
this is going to go:<br>
<p>
"The FHF is dedicated to providing a complete suite of all the hardware<br>
any dedicated hacker needs in order to completely eschew the consumer<br>
society. It will not contain consumer goods, but only items guaranteed<br>
to outlast their owners and provide phenomenally high performance rather<br>
than trashy user interfaces. (For example, the FHF's development work on<br>
the Enhanced Mobility All-terrain Cargo Shifter (Emacs, for short)<br>
resembles a nuclear-powered Hummvee; seats are optional and there's no<br>
air conditioning, but it can carry up to six tons of cargo, has  six<br>
multiply-redundant power transmission circuits, an auxilliary steam<br>
engine, active suspension, and autonomous microsat launch capability<br>
(you think we'd trust PROPRIETARY SOLUTIONS like NavStar or Glonass?!?).<br>
It's the go-anywhere surface terrain vehicle of choice for alternative<br>
technology geeks who aren't afraid of a little plutonium under the hood.<br>
Besides, who needs air conditioning when you've got coolant, air<br>
scrubber, and power interfaces for your space suit? (NB: degrees in<br>
aerospace and nuclear engineering may be required to make full use of <br>
all facilities built in this vehicle. There is no warranty, but if it<br>
doesn't out-last you by 200 years we haven't designed it right.)"<br>
