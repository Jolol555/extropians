<i>        &gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;If I want to sell something, and you want to buy, we agree on a </i><br>
<i>        &gt;price and make the exchange, end of story. It's understandable to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;both of us, it's simple, it's elegant, it works. </i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;anduril@cix.compulink.co.uk (Tony Hollick) </i><br>
<i>        &gt;This is true, but it also completely begs the question of how       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;_either_ of you come to own anything in the first place.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
True, and it doesn't explain why continental drift exists either. I wasn't <br>
talking philosophy, I was talking about a practical way to get things done. <br>
It doesn't matter why people own anything in the first place, the fact is <br>
that in the real world they do and we must deal with it.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;No-one has ever provided a satisfying explanation of how a person         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;comes to 'own' a given piece of land from a state of nature.         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
So what? People undoubtedly do own land and if you believe in determinism, <br>
and I'll bet you do, then there must be a reason that they do, you just don't <br>
know what it is. Even if you did have an explanation, of what practical value  <br>
could it possibly be.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The 'labour-mixing' argument doesn't hold water. [...].The 'resources        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;-mixing' argument begs the first question      </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That could be, but I wouldn't know. What are those arguments?<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why is your labour not just wasted effort?        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If your labor is foolish then it is wasted effort, not all labor is of equal<br>
value, or of any value at all. The great thing about the market is that it <br>
will tell  you very quickly if you're working smart or stupid.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Look back far enough, and you find something pretty questionable         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(or outright predatory). </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Look back far enough, and you can find anything you want. It's pointless to <br>
worry about what a bunch of dead men I never met did to another bunch of dead <br>
men I never met, I just want the best system for making me rich, free, and <br>
happy and it certainly isn't socialism.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How, precisely, do you assert 'your' exclusive property claim to       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;_anything_, without   threatening to initiate _violence_ againt a       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;non-violent 'intruder'?        </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Obviously you can not, who said you could?    <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Let's choose the (Pareto-optimal?) catallaxy together; and agree       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;shares in the output; and that way, we _all_ gain from selecting the       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;most productive, rights-enhancing system."</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Feel free to do just that if you think you can, but I'll pass. <br>
    <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Here, we had the goddamn Norman invaders stealing everything from </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the indigenous Saxons, Celts, Angles etc., destroyingtheir free ways </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of life, and subjugating them. [...] So first we have predatory </i><br>
<i>        &gt;feaudalism (or whatever) and thus  a distribution of property (and </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the positional advantages property buys over time), and the resulting </i><br>
<i>        &gt;patterns of injustice aren't of any concern? </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
It's of absolutely no concern to me because the perpetrators of the injustice <br>
as well as the victims have all been dead for a thousand years. With the  <br>
exception of Antarctica , every square inch of land on planet Earth has been <br>
stolen from somebody else a thousand times over, I can't sort it out and I <br>
see no reason to even try. I don't believe in object morality but I do think <br>
it would be nice if most people were free and rich most of the time. If your<br>
goal is a happy creative world you will never achieve it by trying avenge <br>
every ancient crime.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why does 'capital' hire 'labour'? Why does not 'labour' hire        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;'capital' for time-preference (interest) plus a risk factor?  </i><br>
              <br>
<p>
That's exactly what happens when a working man gets a loan from a bank and <br>
buys a house.                          <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why do we still have a _hierarchical_ - 'Crony-Capitalist' --       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;verticalist structure for our prevailing version of a 'free-market'         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;society, when most people would prefer a much more 'horizontal'         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reticular --  Agorist! --  pattern of economic interactions?</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
I can't answer your question because I have no idea what your question is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;we have to adapt our vector-driven catallactic economic systems to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the 21st Century.       </i><br>
                                                  <br>
Right. Ah, ... Is your vector-driven catallactic fuel injection or does it  <br>
have a carburetor?                                <br>
