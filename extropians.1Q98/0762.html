Col. L. Fletcher Prouty did several secret operations, served the coordination<br>
between<br>
CIA, Air Force and the National Security Council and was in personal contact<br>
with<br>
CIA-Director Dulles, the Minister of Defense, the generals and the CIA-agents.<br>
He was<br>
in the "Office of Special Operations" and from 1962 to 1963 he was director of<br>
"Special <br>
Operations" for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon. One of the best<br>
historical<br>
references you can get for secret operations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Not only are your examples way out of context, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrelevant.  Bell Helicopter was *the* vendor of helicopters to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; military *long* before the Vietnam (First delivery to the military in</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1946).  Additionally, Bell was  one of the most prominent developers of new</i><br>
<i>&gt; aerospace technologies from WWII through the Vietnam War (first American</i><br>
<i>&gt; jet powered aircraft, first aircraft to break the sound barrier, *the*</i><br>
<i>&gt; leader in helicopter technology, etc) and received numerous military</i><br>
<i>&gt; contracts during the time period prior to the Vietnam war.  The founder of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bell (Larry Bell?) died circa 1956, at which point the essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaderless company became more or less for sale until they were finally</i><br>
<i>&gt; bought by Textron in 1960.  </i><br>
<p>
I never contradicted anything in this paragraph.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; First National Bank had very little to do with</i><br>
<i>&gt; promoting a company who at the time was already considered to be the leader</i><br>
<i>&gt; in military helicopter technology.</i><br>
<p>
Microsoft was considered to be the leader in operating systems in 1992. Now<br>
what is it<br>
today? The super-leader? Capital accumulates, money goes where money is and<br>
banks <br>
only invest where they can make money. And First National made a lot of money<br>
with Bell/Textron. The helicopter war was an absolute waste of money and<br>
strategically <br>
useless. Of 6415 deaths related to aircraft, 1792 happened in plane crashes<br>
and 4622<br>
in helicopters. Of these 4622 deaths, 1981 (43 %) occurred without any<br>
influence of the enemy. Prouty: "If you had an helicopter, you didn't need any<br>
enemies anymore." Still,<br>
they were used in huge numbers. The US Army didn't know a lot, but they knew<br>
how this<br>
disaster could have been avoided. But they didn't want to avoid it -- it was<br>
part of the strategy.<br>
<p>
Similar for the Eurofighter project running now. They officially pay DM 50<br>
billion (!!!) <br>
for it (without the weapon systems), and it's hopelessly overaged. I don't<br>
regret this (in fact I prefer inactive weapons) but it's a great present to<br>
those building it. Will probably cost them 10 % of what they earn with it. And<br>
who pays this present? I do, with loan taxes and value added tax, which will<br>
be raised once again next year (while my potential pension will be decreased<br>
again). <br>
<p>
You say: The government steals your money. But the government gives the money<br>
to those producing the Eurofighter (and other industries). It's just<br>
redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich -- some weird kind of Robin<br>
Hood game. How blind must you be not to see this?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Boeing is an even stupider example, which I'll get to in a moment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; To blame "Businessmen" for wars, you must ignore the fact that MOST</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; of them, on either side, LOSE money in wartime.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I don't ignore it, it's true. But the really big enterprises, of course</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;especially arms industry, usually profit from war -- and the big banks behind</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;them do as well.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You shot yourself in the foot here.  Boeing nearly went *bankrupt* after</i><br>
<i>&gt; WWII, as production of wartime products effectively stopped.  Boeing bet</i><br>
<i>&gt; the entire company on the 707 whiched was successful enough to keep the</i><br>
<i>&gt; company going.</i><br>
<p>
You're right, they nearly went bankrupt after war. *After* war. Quoting from<br>
their<br>
web site:<br>
<p>
"At the height of the war, Boeing was assembling 362 B-17s per month. Yet that<br>
effort paled in comparison to production at North American, which built 42,683<br>
airplanes -- including more than 15,000 T-6 Texan trainers -- for an average<br>
of nearly 600 airplanes per month during World War II."<br>
<p>
While it ran, it brought the banks behind Boeing profit. Certainly. (Although<br>
I don't know who was behind Boeing at that time and whether they exited after<br>
the war - would be interesting.) Of course, when war is over and you've got<br>
all your factories running at warp speed, you'll get problems. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The huge profit increases from '65-'70 correspond to the wildly successful</i><br>
<i>&gt; sales of the Boeing 727 (starting in 1964) and the best-selling commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; aircraft ever, the 737, which became an instant success when introduced in</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1967.  The large profit increases you noted were in no way related to war</i><br>
<i>&gt; time efforts, but in the commercial sector instead.</i><br>
<p>
You might be right here. But while you insinuate that what I presented was<br>
based on a "conspiracy theory", you did not give any sources at all. This<br>
makes things a lot easier. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I *seriously* suggest that you take the time to research your evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt; prior to puking this crap all over the mailing list.  By citing your sole</i><br>
<i>&gt; source as a conspiracy novel, you make yourself look like even more of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; idiot.</i><br>
<p>
Your insults and those of others (you're not the first and not the last one<br>
calling me an idiot) just show me that you have no serious arguments against<br>
me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Rich families are always in the top political positions because it is very</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive to be a politician.  This is true even in the most socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries.  But it is a good investment for rich people because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government is an advantageous source of power that they can control.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; source of power that wouldn't exist on the free market.  Take away this</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfair advantage and they have to compete based on their virtues, just like</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone else.</i><br>
<p>
Utter nonsense. We're not just talking about "a rich family" with a few<br>
millions set aside. We're talking about a family with connections to the<br>
people who trade *BILLIONS* every day. These people can put an end to any<br>
company they own, if they want to see Sun dead, Sun is dead, if they want to<br>
see M$ dead, Bill will get a run for his money.<br>
Such direct influence as happened with Bush is rare, but sometimes it occurs.<br>
In most cases, politicians are just straw men. Richard Nixon applied for the<br>
job of a politician when he read an announcement in a newspaper. They're<br>
recruited by the power elite, told what to do and they do it. Period.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well duh.  That's the whole point.  A free market economy has never been</i><br>
<i>&gt; tried in any significant sense because government always gets in the way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think the government wants a free market? </i><br>
<p>
They do not want the truly free market you imagine. As I said before, it could<br>
be nice. But it won't work because some kind of government - I couldn't have<br>
said it better myself - always gets in the way. It's simply economically<br>
impossible. Power structures exist, the money *is* concentrated. Money will<br>
keep its value when government is removed - and those who possess will be able<br>
to exercise power. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Come to Silicon Valley</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometime and ask your average independant consultant.  Even a "pseudo-free</i><br>
<i>&gt; market" like the Internet scares the hell out of government because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; devalues their power structures.  But hey, they're in a postion to</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislate that nuisance away...</i><br>
<p>
We can make a little bet. Two bets, to be precise. Bet number one: E-commerce<br>
with cybercash will boom in the next two years. Bet number two: Mainly the<br>
(semi-)monopolies of today (who don't miss the train) will profit from it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So what are you missing?  It obviously follows that if you eliminate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government, you eliminate the power elite.</i><br>
<p>
No, that's the major mistake you make. You only eliminate the current form of<br>
government. It will immediately (!) be replaced by a new form, probably more<br>
brutal. <br>
But we're just talking theoretical. You won't be able to accomplish this, not<br>
even with Eugene in your militia. The problem is that parts of the power elite<br>
might do it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Another example is the United States, where unemployment is at a record</i><br>
<i>&gt; lows attributed almost entirely to increased productivity in the economy.</i><br>
<p>
Yawn. Your record lows have been refuted so often, it's getting boring. First,<br>
you count the jobs. Second, the standard of living has decreased together with<br>
the loans. Third, the accumulation of money has also increased. I have posted<br>
evidence for all of this before, but you will find it on my web page<br>
(<a href="http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html">http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/documents.html</a>) in case you weren't there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The only people who have to work harder are people too inflexible or too</i><br>
<i>&gt; stupid to work smarter.  Average people would enjoy the benefits of</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress a great deal more if they spent more of their energy accustomizing</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves to it rather than resisting it.  Ability to adapt *is* an</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary advantage.</i><br>
<p>
You have misunderstood me. I advocate many kinds of progress, from cloning to<br>
nanotechnology. Much is pointless, like cryo, but I'd like to see it develop<br>
anyway. It just has to be cleverly used. People are simply too uneducated. If<br>
we could educate the power elites, this would probably be good enough to<br>
ensure a better living.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In a free market economy, it is highly unlikely that all the major</i><br>
<i>&gt; industries would be making record profits and unemployment would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; increasing.  </i><br>
<p>
I have the evidence around me. Our economy is as free as a bee (i.e. as free<br>
as the power elites want it to be). Darwinian selection doesn't work very well<br>
since people have gained the ability to destroy each other in large numbers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Too protect populations from people with power who don't have your high</i><br>
<i>&gt; moral standards?  Actually, there is a rather large difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt; European militaries and the US military in general (which may be tempering</i><br>
<i>&gt; your view).  In many European countries (Germany, for example) the military</i><br>
<i>&gt; is used as an auxiliary police arm of the government, many times quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; violently.  This is simply not the case with the professional US</i><br>
<i>&gt; militaries, which have virtually no adversarial contact within the domestic</i><br>
<i>&gt; population.</i><br>
<p>
The military is rarely, if ever used as an auxiliary police arm in Germany.<br>
Most of the time it just sits around doing nothing. (They want to participate<br>
in the coming war in Bosnia, but it remains to be seen whether they'll be able<br>
to do it. Our current defense minister won't take part in it, this is sure.)<br>
Still they buy weapons and cost us lots of money. I have to pay for this shit.<br>
I don't like that, but the less real government we have, the more I'll have to<br>
pay.<br>
