Homosexual acts between consenting adults in private were legalized in<br>
the UK in 1968.<br>
<p>
Arthur C. Clarke left the UK for Sri Lanka in 1962, at short notice. (He<br>
has, however, revisited the UK since 1970 once or twice.)<br>
<p>
There are rumours in UK SF fandom that, allegedly, he left because he had<br>
been told that the Vice Squad were going to pay him a visit in the very<br>
near future if he didn't. The allegations were that Clarke was gay, not that<br>
he was a paedophile -- at a time when homosexuality was a criminal offense.<br>
<p>
I draw no connection between the allegations and the date of legalisation<br>
of homosexuality in the UK except to point out that if the allegations were<br>
true they would be compatible with the observed course of events.<br>
<p>
It is worth noting that one of the events of Prince Charles' current visit<br>
to Sri Lanka is to bestow a knighthood on Arthur C. Clarke.<br>
<p>
(Phew)<br>
