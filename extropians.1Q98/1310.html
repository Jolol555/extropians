Ah, here's my cue to spew my microbiology reading: Brock and Madigan,<br>
_Biology of Microorganisms_.  The ruminants are, in a sense, not<br>
vegetarians.  They eat grass, but that goes to the rumen, which is<br>
basicually a fermentation vat for bacteria.  The latter turn the grass<br>
into various chemicals (fatty acids) and more bacteria.  Some of the<br>
former are absorbed directly.  Many of the latter ride the cud back into<br>
the stomach.  So in a sense a cow is a bacteriovore, not an herbivore;<br>
the grass is just feedstock for the germs.<br>
<p>
Rabbits are not ruminamts.  They do host a large population of bacteria,<br>
but it's on the wrong end of their digestive tract.  Thus the recycling,<br>
and the comment about kosherness.<br>
<p>
The book said horses have the same problem, but AFAIK they do not have<br>
the same solution.  I think horses can live wholly on grass, so I'm not<br>
sure what's going on there.  Help would be welcome.<br>

I've heard that you can die of fat starvation if your diet consists<br>
wholly of wild jackrabbit and other low-fat foods.  Even if true, I<br>
doubt that would apply to domestic rabbit, which does not spend most of<br>
its life as a solid running muscle.<br>

"Reminds me of a humorous sf story I read a few years back where an <br>
amoeboid alien escaped punishment this way (it was guilty of selling <br>
pornographic pictures to earthly biologists who used them to illustrate<br>
mitosis in their textbooks). Both the resulting individuals claimed <br>
innocence, and pointed out that they were underage."<br>
