I'd argue that the date could be that of the first memory the child has.<br>
This is a date which will change over time, and be very difficult to<br>
establish, particularly in the early years.<br>
<p>
Most adults I know don't recall anything before their third birthday, so I<br>
would argue that up at least to that point they were still part of their<br>
mothers.<br>
<p>
Alternatively, it could be the date the child becomes independent, which is<br>
of course rather later.<br>
