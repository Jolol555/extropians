      John K Clark writes eloquently, and well:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>|If I want to sell something, and you want to buy, we agree on a price and</i><br>
<i>|make the exchange, end of story. It's understandable to both of us, it's</i><br>
<i>|simple, it's elegant, it works. A system that was as simple as the market and</i><br>
<i>|worked as well, would have been found by now, and as I have not heard any</i><br>
<i>|reports of this interesting development, leads me to believe that it does not</i><br>
<i>|exist. A protocol that needs 10 years of super computer time before I can buy</i><br>
<i>|a can od beer is not better than the market, regardless of what it's other</i><br>
<i>|virtues may be.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
      This is true, but it also completely begs the question of how <br>
      _either_ of you come to own anything in the first place.  No-one has <br>
      ever provided a satisfying explanation of how a person comes to <br>
      'own' a given piece of land from a state of nature.  The <br>
      'labour-mixing' argument doesn't hold water.  Why is your labour not <br>
      just wasted effort?  The 'resources-mixing' argument begs the first <br>
      question, and fails Nozick's test of why -- if you pour a can of <br>
      beer into the Pacific -- you haven't just wasted 'your' beer, <br>
      instead of acquiring a part-share in the Pacific!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
      There is a legal maxim: "Non Dat Quod Non Habet" (you cannot give <br>
      what you do not have).  97% of American land is owned by around 3% <br>
      of the population, or so I understand.  Wonder why there's this wild <br>
      skew?  It bears looking into.  Look back far enough, and you find <br>
      something pretty questionable (or outright predatory).  Partial land <br>
      rights in 80% of Australia are presently being awarded to <br>
      Aboriginals by the Australian civil courts.  The politicians are <br>
      threatening revocation.<br>
<p>
      Next problem: As the Austrian Economists tell us, catallaxies (or <br>
      economic games) are abstract 'Wertfrei' systems capapble of <br>
      configuration in a myriad ways.  How do we decide on which <br>
      _particular_ catallaxy is operative?   You're no better off with <br>
      'Chicago School' reasoning either: Milton Friedman points out that <br>
      property rights _cannot_ be ontological; and are ineluctably _agreed <br>
      conventions_.  How do you handle problems of unequal bargaining <br>
      powers?  Coerced 'consent'?<br>
      <br>
      You would surely counsel any player in the economic game to seek the <br>
      best deal possible for their consent to any _particular_ game taking <br>
      place, wouldn't you?  Remember Lee Marvin and Toshio Mifune in 'Hell <br>
      in the Pacific'?  A lovely and illuminating movie, with Marvin as a <br>
      coarse, predatory G.I.; and Mifune as a refined, gratification <br>
      delaying Japanese hunter-gatherer and producer. They're shipwrecked <br>
      together on a Pacific island in WWII.  Marvin can always screw up <br>
      Mifune's hunting, gathering and production unless given his 'share' <br>
      in the 'take'.  A 'modus vivendi' must somehow be reached, or <br>
      pre-emptive 'race-to-kill-first' rules come into play.<br>
<p>
<p>
      A fair part of your body was once part of other peoples' bodies.  If <br>
      their heirs could prove this, should you give the 'pound of flesh' <br>
      back?  Even if you _could_?<br>
<p>
      <br>
      The LeFevrian Agorist Objection: How, precisely, do you assert <br>
      'your' exclusive property claim to _anything_, without threatening <br>
      to initiate _violence_ againt a non-violent 'intruder'?  Rather as <br>
      the white Australian farmers did against the nomadic 'Abos.'  When I <br>
      lived in Australia, attending Geelong Grammar School, I used to hear <br>
      stories of armed 'Abo' hunts at week-ends, and bowls of 'free' <br>
      poisoned porridge placed conveniently near fences...  The 'Abos' <br>
      couldn't get it through their thick heads that the settlers believed <br>
      _they_ owned all the -- 'Terra Nullius' -- land now.  And all those <br>
      tasty woolly white animals wandering around all over it...<br>
<p>
      You see the problem?<br>
<p>
<p>
      Rather than engage in a fruitless search for 'ontological' property <br>
      rights, isn't it better to offer people this deal?<br>
      <br>
      "Let's choose the (Pareto-optimal?) catallaxy together; and agree <br>
      shares in the output; and that way, we _all_ gain from selecting the <br>
      most productive, rights-enhancing system."<br>
<p>
      This becomes especially important as the classical-liberal model of <br>
      economic participation fails, as intelligent machines pre-empt even <br>
      the dollar-a-day penns, Lao-Gai slaves and Asian sweatshop <br>
      labourers. If we are to preserve the priceless (!) core values of <br>
      classical liberalism (and I hope we do!), we have to adapt our <br>
      vector-driven catallactic economic systems to the 21st Century.<br>
      <br>
      Most people cannot hope to play the economic game and win against <br>
      intelligent machines; any more than World Champion Garry Kasparov <br>
      can make a living playing chess against chess computers for piece <br>
      rates.  That way lies the Marxian madness of fewer and fewer <br>
      capitalists immiserating a greater and greater number of everyday <br>
      people.  Here, we had the goddamn Norman invaders stealing <br>
      everything from the indigenous Saxons, Celts, Angles etc., <br>
      destroyingtheir free ways of life, and subjugating them.  <br>
<p>
      A thousand years later, and the Norman bastards (or rather, their <br>
      bastard descendants) still have around 90% of all the land and all <br>
      the money and all the power, and are overdue for expropriation.<br>
      <br>
      Or do you rather want us to find a fine future in our -- feudal -- <br>
      past?  &gt;:-}<br>
