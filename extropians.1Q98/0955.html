Announcement for the NECSI working group: Information Mechanics<br>
===============================================================<br>
<p>
First meeting:<br>
<p>
Topic: Physical Limits to Computation.<br>
Location: A room will be reserved on the MIT campus.<br>
Date: Friday, Jan 30.<br>
Schedule: 9am - 5pm, including a relaxed,informal lunch, lunch will be<br>
served on the premises, possibility of going out to dinner afterwards<br>
for those who wish.<br>
Fee: We ask that each participant contribute $20, which will provide for<br>
all refreshments and the lunch.<br>
<p>
Second meeting:<br>
<p>
Topic: Information flow in non-equilibrium systems.<br>
Location: again MIT.<br>
Date: Friday, March 27.<br>
Schedule: similar, if we find that it works.<br>
<p>
Participation:<br>
<p>
Participation is limited to 30 people and is by application/invitation<br>
only.  This is to ensure easy, informal communication between those<br>
present. Interested people should contact me, Rick Bagley:<br>
                        Richard.Bagley@digital.com,<br>
with their queries and contributions.  Michel Baranger and I are the<br>
organizers.  We will notify registered participants (and send<br>
directions) via email beforehand.<br>
<p>
What is expected of participants?:<br>
<p>
Participants should be ready to present ideas which contribute to the<br>
theme.<br>
<p>
There will be no long formal talks. But hopefully there will be many<br>
interested, knowledgeable people ready to contribute something from<br>
their own work, some work from the literature, well-posed questions,<br>
suggestions for collaborations, etc.  We welcome suggestions from<br>
participants beforehand concerning the format, the topics, or possible<br>
speakers.<br>
<p>
Topics:<br>
<p>
Here are some possible topics to provoke interest:<br>
<p>
- Potential and limitations of quantum computation (recent work on<br>
teleportation is topical)<br>
- Limits to the efficiency of a parallel computation (as a function of<br>
the number of processors, or alternatively, the fundamental limits to<br>
the decomposition of a computation)<br>
- The possible role of self-organization in computation<br>
- Minimal energy requirements for communication (ref: Landauer: 1996<br>
Science 272:1914)<br>
- Symbolic dynamics of dynamical systems seen as computational systems,<br>
and association of dynamics regimes with different characterizations of<br>
computation<br>
- Stability of a computation, and the role and limitations of error<br>
correction, randomness<br>
- Algorithmic stability (perhaps not directly relevant to physical<br>
aspects of computation? )<br>
- Applications of coding theory<br>
<p>
We encourage interested people to contribute topics and improve upon<br>
this list.<br>
<p>
There will also be a web-based bulletin board available for the group to<br>
augment the overall discussion.<br>
<p>
The first meeting will allow time for exploration of the subjects of<br>
future working group meetings and the objectives for collective<br>
contributions from these meetings.<br>
<p>
