Life Sciences 61(11): 1037-1044 1997<br>

Summary:<br>
<p>
  Eighty two beagle dogs ranging in age from 2.8 to 16.4 years and in<br>
weight from 6.3 to 15.8 kg were allotted to 41 pairs and administered<br>
placebo or 1 mg/kg l-deprenyl orally once daily for 2 years and 10 weeks.<br>
When survivorship for all dogs in the study was analyzed there was no<br>
significant difference between the l-deprenyl and placebo treated groups,<br>
most likely due to the (expected) survival of virtually all young dogs in<br>
both groups for the duration of the study. To assess whether l-deprenyl<br>
treatment begun in later life might enhance canine longevity in a fashion<br>
similar to that documented in rodents we also examined survival in a<br>
fashion similar to that documented in rodents we also examined survival in<br>
a subset of elderly dogs who were between the ages of 10 and 15 yrs at the<br>
start of tablet administration and who recieved tablets for at least 6<br>
months. In this subset, dogs in the l-deprenyl group survived longer<br>
(p&lt;0.05) than dogs in the placebo group. Twelve of 15 (80%) dogs in the<br>
l-deprenyl group survived to the conclusion of the study, in contrast to<br>
only 7 of 18 (39%) of the dogs who recieved placebo (p=0.017). Furthermore,<br>
by the time the first l-deprenyl treated dog died on day 427, 5 placebo<br>
treated dogs had already succumbed, the first on day 295. Specifically with<br>
respect to dogs, the findings reported herein suggest daily oral<br>
administration of 1 mg/kg l-deprenyl prolongs life when begun in relatively<br>
healthy dogs 10-15 years of age and maintained for the duration of the<br>
individual's life, but in any event for no less than six months.<br>
