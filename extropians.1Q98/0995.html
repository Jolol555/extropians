[My Humanity vs. God movie idea...]<br>
<i>&gt; An entity claiming to be God announces that it is here to take over</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; Earth.  It gives "omnipotent" information that convinces the</i><br>
Churches of<br>
<i>&gt; all religions that it really is God.  (Probably secret information</i><br>
hidden<br>
<i>&gt; by the elite rulers of each religion.)  The religious believe and</i><br>
accept<br>
<i>&gt; "God".  Atheists and scientists disbelieve "God", and think he's an</i><br>
alien,<br>
<i>&gt; future entity, or something from another dimension.  They wage war</i><br>
with<br>
<i>&gt; "God", and must function underground because most of the Earth</i><br>
believes in<br>
<i>&gt; "God".  God fights with almost omnipotent power and/or future</i><br>
nanotech.<br>
<i>&gt; After a greatly entertaining story, the humans win.</i><br>
<p>
But the original point was - "That's God, our all powerful creator. <br>
What the hell, let's kill him anyway."  You've lost the whole social<br>
comment!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Conclusion:  The religious decide that it could not have been God,</i><br>
because<br>
<i>&gt; we won.  It must have been the false-God as prophesied for the end</i><br>
times.<br>
<i>&gt; They announce that since the false-God prophesy was real, that this</i><br>
really<br>
<i>&gt; proves that there is a God!  They also announce that  according to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; now-proven prophesies, the real God is coming real-soon now.  (Hook</i><br>
for the<br>
<i>&gt; blockbuster sequel!)</i><br>
<p>
I like the ending, just like real life.<br>
<p>
Anyway here's the story so far:  Crowded street, traffic jam (tip: all<br>
good movies have traffic jams) a strange winged creature falls out of<br>
the sky and land on the top of a taxi (tip: if you're going to focus<br>
on one car make it a taxi, taxis pull crowds) and that's as far as I<br>
got.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Please make out my portion of the royalties in U.S. funds to Harvey</i><br>
<i>&gt; Newstrom.  Thanks.</i><br>
<p>
The check is in the post.  Here's some other sci-fi themes ticking<br>
over in my mind:<br>
<p>
An uploaded universe ruled by a "Reality Council" who decides what's<br>
real and what's not, young hopefuls struggle to make it up the<br>
political ladder so that they can reap the benefits of being able to<br>
pass "Reality Legislation." <br>
<p>
A Sci-fi television series where there are no psychics and/or social<br>
comments.<br>
<p>
Aliens land and don't want to judge us because we're so barbaric.<br>
<p>
The worlds first science fiction novel that actually covers social<br>
changes beyond - "We no longer shake hands, we rub feet."<br>
<p>
Androids that don't want to be human.<br>
<p>
An upload who downloads into a human body and is overwhelmed by the<br>
shear lack of substance in the real world.<br>
