Not to mention the rather old lex and yacc, to write parsers.  Kernighan<br>
and Pike wrote that yacc is one of the few survivors from a time when<br>
lots of people were trying to write higher level things.  You specify a<br>
grammar and it writes a parser, reportedly somewhat better than most<br>
programmers could write.  I'm surprised you didn't mention it Lee, since<br>
the Lojban project used it. :)  (Which weirded me out when I first heard<br>
it.)<br>
<p>
At any rate, why shouldn't there be more and more programmers?<br>
Especially if the programmers are teaching computers how to replace many<br>
of the non-programmers.<br>
<p>
Programmers, bio-programmers, and janitors, that's the future...<br>
