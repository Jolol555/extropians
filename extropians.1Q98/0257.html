<p>
My first evidence is that our ancestrals did not age (bacteria don't age<br>
and most of the non-aging species are quite primitive in an evolutionary<br>
scale). If aging "evolved", it can be caused by two types of errors: (1)<br>
old processes that started to fail; or (2) new processes that are not<br>
perfect yet.<br>
About the evolution of aging species towards non-aging species, the<br>
question might be asked of weather these species suppressed aging or<br>
their evolutionary "relatives" in more hazardous positions evolved<br>
aging? I think it can go either way, the best evidence I have supporting<br>
the first option is that there is some evolutionary pressure against<br>
aging in species who live non-hazardous lives. For example, in mammals,<br>
the species with the longest life span (ours), is the one with the<br>
longest maturation time, something that can only be achieved by being on<br>
top of the food chain.<br>
<p>
Anyway, the best is to read my article about the evolution of aging.<br>
It's a long and boring (yes, very boring, I intend to change that soon<br>
by making it smaller) article, the URL (after saying it is boring you<br>
probably won't be interested but...) is:<br>
