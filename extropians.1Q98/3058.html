<i>&gt; From:          "Peter C. McCluskey" &lt;pcm@rahul.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  A better way of understanding deflation (as opposed to the decline in</i><br>
<i>&gt; prices of specific goods relative to some average) is to view it as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; rise in the price of a currency. For significant deflation, think of it</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a speculative bubble where people invest in the currency because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; extrapolate past trends to justify holding increasing proportions of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth as currency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The main reason this is bad is that nominal interest rates can't go much</i><br>
<i>&gt; below zero, so that if deflation is -10%, real interest rates are an</i><br>
<i>&gt; abnormally high 10% or more, preventing most people from borrowing, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; cuts off a significant source of expenditures.</i><br>
<p>
There is historic evidence to indicate that advancing technology, <br>
social economies of scale, etc. have a long-term average effect of <br>
causing deflation in the price of goods, relative to the price of <br>
basic labor, at about 2% per year.  I don't know of any studies of <br>
whether this has increased in, say, the last century in the <br>
industrialized world.<br>
