justice<br>

<i>&gt; tendencies will feel free to act out in the open, and the mayhem</i><br>
<i>&gt; resulting will bring utter chaos. Not to mention that being permissive</i><br>
<i>&gt; on ending another's life puts our own at greater risk of being ended.</i><br>
<p>
Who said anything about being "permissive"?  Self-defence isn't<br>
permissive.<br>
<p>
And then he wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Can you give examples of justice that isn't revenge?</i><br>

<i>&gt; I have a bit more for you here. Civil law seeks to recompensation to</i><br>
<i>&gt; victims for damages incurred. This is not revenge, merely compensation</i><br>
<i>&gt; for damages, reestablishing a semblance of the prior continuum.</i><br>
<p>
Have you ever been in a competition and lost?  Property is whatever<br>
you can stop someone else from taking.  That's not my "property is<br>
theft" opinion, that's fact (go ahead, put it to the test.)  Property<br>
law is simply intervention by a third party.  If you loose a race and<br>
then go and break the winners legs, that's revenge.  If you loose to<br>
crime and then punish the criminal, that's revenge.<br>
<p>
And trust John K Clark to write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Yak Wax:</i><br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;Justice is the need for revenge </i><br>
         <br>
<i>&gt; That's an idea endorsed by the Christian God with His invention of</i><br>
"hell", <br>
<i>&gt; it's the conventional view, and a view that has caused more grief</i><br>
than any <br>
<i>&gt; other in the history of the world. When an idea doesn't work it</i><br>
needs to be <br>
<i>&gt; junked. This idea doesn't work.</i><br>
<p>
So you've got some clever scheme for non-vengeful justice?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;when someone commits a crime against you, what reason do you</i><br>
have to         <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;contact the police?          </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To stop that person from committing new crimes against others and as</i><br>
a <br>
<i>&gt; deterrent discouraging others from committing new crimes against me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's  justice, one bit more and it's vengeance. Making a person</i><br>
unhappy<br>
<i>&gt; because you don't like him and think it's fun to see him suffer is</i><br>
something I want<br>
<i>&gt; no part of.</i><br>
<p>
They've committed the crime, you lost out, and any "justice" incurred<br>
beyond that point is by definition, revenge.<br>

It may be bullshit, but it's inspired bullshit<br>
