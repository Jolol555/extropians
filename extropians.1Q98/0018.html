Oh exactly, however, concepts like enforceable personal sovereignty are<br>
not recognized by the legal system we have, which indicates how little<br>
weight the current legal system puts toward the idea of Natural Law. I<br>
personally prefer the concept to the alternative, the force doctrine,<br>
with the exception that I don't want to HAVE to beleive in an external<br>
diety to confer those rights on me, but like the big bang, I don't<br>
really see any alternative, so I live by the force doctrine. Since<br>
devices like the Constitution were enacted as a result of the will (by<br>
force) of a group of people to govern themselves, that is as close as<br>
one can possibly come to my ideal at this present time. What I was<br>
trying to point out with the references to that document was that the<br>
statist document itself recognises that all rights an individual can<br>
think of, that are not already enumerated elsewhere in that document, or<br>
are not enumerated in a State Constitution the the individual resides in<br>
(as permitted by the 10th amendment), do belong to and originate from<br>
the people (i.e. individuals). Given this, I was pointing out how the<br>
statists are not even obeying their own highest law in that they<br>
routinely ignore the 9th amendment when it is to their best interest<br>
(which is ususally all the time).<br>
<p>
I don't see you or anyone else out fighting a geurilla insurgency<br>
against the state, so don't tell me that I am blindly and willfully<br>
bowing down to the state. I do act, on a daily or weekly basis, to<br>
exercise those rights of which are presently most endangered in this so<br>
called republic.<br>
