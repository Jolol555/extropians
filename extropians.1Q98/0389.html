You're right, damage and radioactive isotopes caused by neutrons is a serious<br>
problem for a fusion reactor, that's why the reaction I like best is between <br>
non radioactive deuterium (Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this <br>
produces non radioactive Helium 4, an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of <br>
energy, and most important of all, no neutron. Unfortunately you need a <br>
higher temperature to achieve it than the deuterium tritium reaction most are <br>
talking about.<br>

<p>
Novel acceleration principles would be a nice thing to have and I'm sure we'll<br>
find them, but just engineering things better would work wonders. Make a<br>
series of thin aligned rings of copper or some other conductor and put them a<br>
nanometer from each other. The first ring has a modest positive charge of<br>
5 volts on it to pull an electron toward it. When the electron reaches the<br>
center drop the charge on the ring to zero, as soon as the electron passes<br>
put a negative charge of 5 volts on the ring to push the particle on to the<br>
next ring. After one meter the electron would have 10 billion electron volts<br>
on energy.<br>
<p>
We know it would be tricky to get the timing right, to make sure the voltage<br>
on the rings rise and fell exactly when they should, but we also know it's<br>
possible to do so because the original Stanford linear accelerator operates on<br>
exactly this principle, it's just bigger, 2 miles long. The nanotech version<br>
with the arbitrary values given in my example would only need to be about<br>
12 feet long to equal the energy.<br>
