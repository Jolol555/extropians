<i>&gt;I've been thinking about this "Extropian Party" idea, and I think we</i><br>

<i>&gt;1. People are stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. People are stupid</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. People are stupid</i><br>
<p>
Let me guess...  And you are not a people?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So taking these three points into account I have formulated the</i><br>
<i>&gt;following plan for an Extropian Party:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Rather than the usual Libertarian "everyone should be free"</i><br>
<i>&gt;nonsense, I propose - "We should be free.  You should do as we say."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Forget Democracy, Totalitarianism is the only route a modern party</i><br>
<i>&gt;should take.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. Don't shy away from coercion - you're free (remember?) you can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;as you please.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. We're not here to "make a better world" we're here to "make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;better self."  Anyone who isn't a member is simply media fodder - use</i><br>
<i>&gt;em and abuse em.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. Our campaign should be one of lying, cheating and media propaganda</i><br>
<i>&gt;- in an election you can't stoop too low.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At this point many of you may think I'm joking - I'm not.  So I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;better explain myself:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By creating a system where everyone's free I can't guarantee that</i><br>
<i>&gt;everything will go my way, there's bound to be some post-democracy</i><br>
<i>&gt;fallout of people who don't know what to do, so they'll carry on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;way they were.  Added to that are the people who are just inherently</i><br>
<i>&gt;stupid.  So what we want is a Totalitarian society that rewards the</i><br>
<i>&gt;intellectual (democracy tries to make everyone equal - big mistake!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;and ignores anyone against it.  And before the knee-jerk "you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hitler" mails come my way, Hitler (just like the majority of leaders)</i><br>
<i>&gt;was trying to make a better world, I'm simply trying to make the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;better for myself (a far more admirable goal.)</i><br>
<p>
In creating a total state, you create a machine in which those who<br>
just want power can take over.  The Joe Stalins and Idi Amins can<br>
then move in, clean out the Extropians and other transhumanists,<br>
take over the machine and use it just to expand their power.<br>
<p>
And there are a lot of people out there who just want power.  Are<br>
you sure only your boys/girls/hermaphrodites will be the ones<br>
holding the reins?<br>
<p>
I've a better plan, uplift octopodes and everything else, do all other<br>
kinds of research underground and create new technologies that<br>
the government can't control -- from new forms of money to new<br>
ways to communicate.  Present faits accompli so that all the rest<br>
of humanity can do is live with it.<br>
<p>
This way, the effort you would've wasted on building the super<br>
state will be better used on making the stuff you need to<br>
ascend to posthumanity.<br>
<p>
A'bas l'etat!<br>
