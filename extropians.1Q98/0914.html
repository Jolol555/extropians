<i>&gt; As the colonization wave spreads, the frontier surface that they </i><br>

<i>&gt; the universe decreases over time as a result of expansion, this </i><br>
<i>&gt; decrease might slow enough so that amount of matter that </i><br>
<i>&gt; could be sent back to origo at any moment would diverge as t goes to </i><br>
<i>&gt; infinity. This could allow an infinity of computations at origo.</i><br>
<p>
One flaw with this plan, which is actually mentioned by Tipler, is that<br>
there will be an infinite number of civilizations in the universe, each<br>
with only a finite volume of space they can use.  Now, maybe you could<br>
assume that when different civilizations meet, they will combine their<br>
resources and collect them together at one point.  However, this would<br>
have to go on an infinite number of times.  Maybe this is not really any<br>
worse though than Tipler's assumption that life throughout the universe<br>
will cooperate an infinite number of times to keep the universe collapsing<br>
the right way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I did some back of the envelope calculations. I think the expansion </i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of the universe (if it is open) will asymptotically approach a </i><br>
<i>&gt; constant (could anybody confirm this?). So the density of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; universe would decrease as t^3, for large values of t, and the volume </i><br>
<i>&gt; from of the space where we can have harvested a constant fraction of </i><br>
<i>&gt; its matter content grows as t^3 (if the probes have constant speed </i><br>
<i>&gt; ans since the volume of a sphere is proportional to R^3). So far, </i><br>
<i>&gt; things look bright.</i><br>
<p>
Parenthetically, it grows faster than t^3 because of the hyperbolic<br>
geometry, but this should not be too significant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But then I thought of this problem. Suppose the probes travel with </i><br>
<i>&gt; the speed v. Then there must be some distance d such that if the </i><br>
<i>&gt; probes start at that distance, they will never return to origo. For </i><br>
<i>&gt; if d is big enough, then by the time the probes have traveled 10% of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the way, the remaining 90% will have grown larger than the original </i><br>
<i>&gt; 100%, due to the expansion of space inbetween. So if that expansion </i><br>
<i>&gt; rate settles down to a constant, then there must be a sphere centered </i><br>
<i>&gt; around Earth such that nothing that is outside of that sphere can </i><br>
<i>&gt; *ever* affect Earth, even if it travels with the speed of light. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hence the above proposal fails, unless somebody can point to some </i><br>
<i>&gt; mistake in this reasoning.</i><br>
<p>
I think this is right for normal velocities, but I'm not sure it<br>
generalizes to the speed of light.  I find a lot of references to<br>
the behavior of light in a collapsing universe, how many times it can<br>
circumnavigate during the collapse, but I will have to do more study to<br>
figure out what happens in an expanding universe.  My intuition though<br>
is that the region of space which can affect the earth will grow without<br>
bounds, and that there is no limit to how far a photon can travel in an<br>
infinite universe.<br>
