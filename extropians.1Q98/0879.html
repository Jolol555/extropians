<i>&gt;novel though.</i><br>
<p>
Here's a simple solution:<br>
An entity claiming to be God announces that it is here to take over the<br>
Earth.  It gives "omnipotent" information that convinces the Churches of<br>
all religions that it really is God.  (Probably secret information hidden<br>
by the elite rulers of each religion.)  The religious believe and accept<br>
"God".  Atheists and scientists disbelieve "God", and think he's an alien,<br>
future entity, or something from another dimension.  They wage war with<br>
"God", and must function underground because most of the Earth believes in<br>
"God".  God fights with almost omnipotent power and/or future nanotech.<br>
After a greatly entertaining story, the humans win.<br>
<p>
Conclusion:  The religious decide that it could not have been God, because<br>
we won.  It must have been the false-God as prophesied for the end times.<br>
They announce that since the false-God prophesy was real, that this really<br>
proves that there is a God!  They also announce that  according to the<br>
now-proven prophesies, the real God is coming real-soon now.  (Hook for the<br>
blockbuster sequel!)<br>

Please make out my portion of the royalties in U.S. funds to Harvey<br>
Newstrom.  Thanks.<br>
