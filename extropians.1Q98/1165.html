Point of order: first, she resigned (under extreme pressure). _Then_ there<br>
was a nasty little scramble for the top of the greasy pole, which Major<br>
somehow won.<br>

<p>
... er, and some of us who ended up paying _higher_ taxes as a result<br>
of her policies.<br>

<p>
Unask that question, or I'll ask it's inverse: why did the electoral <br>
system let someone who was voted _against_ by 55-60% of the electorate<br>
retain power? (Answer: "first past the post". Which we -- in the UK and<br>
also in the USA -- have been conditioned to believe is a "fair" way of<br>
running elections. Yeah, and I have this neat bridge you might want to<br>
buy ... there's a lot to be said for a RON box on every ballot paper.)<br>
