<i>&gt; &gt; I live in Australia. We have one of the highest standards of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; living in the world. I can't honestly think of a single person I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know who in any way envies life in the United States. [thinks</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hard]  Nup.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, I know a few Australians who live in California by choice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Our government, of course, "protects" us from many others who would</i><br>
<i>&gt; make that choice.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; While most other democratic governments utilize a parliamentary system of government,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; these have proven to be rather unstable and prone to rapid populist influence (bread and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; circuses),</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Oh. Okay. You are of course referring to something other than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Westminster System which as far as I know is quite a robust</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; parliamentary system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robust because plurality elections produce a two-party system and thus</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually give one party a majority which it would not have in a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; representative system.  Thus the ruling party can weild sweeping power</i><br>
<i>&gt; without provoking constitutional crises; I'm not convinced that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; entirely a good thing. ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I advocate proportional representation with a separately-elected</i><br>
<i>&gt; executive - and high standards for the use of power.)</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Two words: Ronald Reagan.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Four words: Longest peacetime economic expansion.  I'm not a fan of his,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but what's your point?  Maybe it's self-evident to you, but I don't read</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same papers you read.</i><br>

Apparently he doesn't. additionally: End of the Soviet Union, as credited by the KGB itself.<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; the US uses a republican system with, as you must know, three equally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful branches that are capable of checking the other. This system provides a measure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; of negative feedback that helps hold in check the most contagious of populist fads and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; foolishness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You are of course joking. The President of the United States has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as much power as the other two branches of government. This has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; always struck me as dangerously absurd, but given that it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; created in the wake of a monarchy, understandable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Has Tony Blair less power?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We are taught in elementary school that none of our three branches can</i><br>
<i>&gt; do much of anything without at least tacit consent of the other two (the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "checks and balances").  In practice, the "balances" have long since</i><br>
<i>&gt; gone out of whack and the "checks" function more the other way, to put</i><br>
<i>&gt; each branch in the pocket of the others - in particular, the judiciary</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the creature of the very people against whom it is supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; protect us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (If I were at Philadelphia in 1787, I'd have argued against creating a</i><br>
<i>&gt; separate federal judiciary.)</i><br>
<p>
If I were in Philly, I would have created them separate, and with separate capitals. Putting all<br>
the rats in one town to collude together is the problem. Possibly have them separately elected,<br>
though I don't really have that much faith in elected judges.<br>
