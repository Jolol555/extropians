This is beginning to be alleviated. For thousands of years, humans have<br>
supported their agricultural habit by using their own excrement for<br>
fertilizer along with that of their cows and horses and pigs. This practice<br>
ended early in this century with the Progressives pushing through the FDA<br>

No one here advocates purposely destroying species, but if one cannot<br>
compete, then it must either be altered or replaced. maybe an endangered<br>
species' niche is no longer needed (like many North American predators), or<br>
it cannot live by more than a fragile existence. If we are to support the<br>
laws of nature, of which evolution and survival of the fittest are the<br>
paramount ones, then we must not make undue efforts to sustain species which<br>
cannot survive on their own. In this we are extending our own failed welfare<br>
policies to the natural kingdom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Besides, the destructiion of biodiversity is not a very extropian thing</i><br>

<i>&gt; about increasing complexity?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Its also about improvement. If a species cannot cut it, then it either needs<br>
