<i>&gt; I would actually think that the relation to politics should</i><br>
<i>&gt; be still farther from neutral.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Religious fundamentalism, conservatism, or any strong restrictions</i><br>
<i>&gt; on personal, cultural, and technological development do not</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to support any kind of transhumanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are very few political regimes that may support any kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; open-ended, unlimited growth.  Among them, a transhumanist would</i><br>
<i>&gt; freely choose; all others, one should oppose or flee.</i><br>
<p>
I am a religious fundamentalist and transhuman.  My religion<br>
happens to be atheist/libertarian/rationalist, but I have<br>
committed my life to it with the same fervor as any Christian<br>
fundamentalist to eirs, in that it would take some extraordinary<br>
circumstances I can't imagine to change my commitment. <br>
<p>
It would be hypocritical of me to think that my commitment to<br>
non-violent moral standards, and even my commitent to standards<br>
of epistemology and evidence for knowledge of the physical world,<br>
is any different in character from eirs.  Indeed, I may admire<br>
eir commitment even while I ridicule the beliefs themselves.<br>
<p>
Saying that one is "neutral" on issues of politics or morals is<br>
at best meaningless, at worst dishonest.  There's no such thing<br>
as neutrality or objectivity, only varying levels of commitment,<br>
just as there is no such thing as unbiased reporting of political<br>
issues.  The pretense of objectivity does more harm to rational<br>
discourse than any extremist position.<br>
