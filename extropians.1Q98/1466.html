The astoundingly sloppy way this story is being bandied about on the net<br>
appals me.  <br>
<p>
`Young boys' is a term I see repeatedly.  What is mentioned in the<br>
(unsourced) press reports is consensual fondling and fellatio with youths<br>
or young men in their early or mid teens.  Yet surely most people assume<br>
`boy' refers to male humans from birth to 11 or 12, so `*young* boy'<br>
therefore makes the accusation sound like molestation of infants.  No one<br>
has ever suggested that Clarke has been involved in such crimes.<br>
<p>
But it's interesting to look at the original Mirror piece <br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/stories/F0102832.html">http://www.mirror.co.uk/stories/F0102832.html</a><br>
<p>
(assuming the Web version's complete).  There's a lot of malign cutting &amp;<br>
repositioning.  E.g. (I'm going on memory here) allegations of<br>
non-age-specific wickedness with lads is claimed, and then ACC is quoted as<br>
saying that he couldn't admit to certain things or he'd be outed and this<br>
would embarrass everyone in high places.  Later, the context makes it<br>
obvious that he's talking here about gay qua gay plain and simple.  And the<br>
men cited, former `victims', are all recalling stuff from 20 or so years<br>
back, and none of them was 12 at the time; I recall 15 and 17 being<br>
mentioned.  (Cue Romeo and Juliet.)  The youths who were allegedly depraved<br>
and degraded in this fashion met ACC due to their habitual hanging about in<br>
a known den of preverts.  <br>
<p>
Key evidence: filthy Arthur was often seen *playing ping-pong with boys of<br>
12*!!  There you go!  What more proof is needed!  Arrest the scout-masters!<br>
 (Not exactly what'd be required in a prosecution, I imagine.)<br>
