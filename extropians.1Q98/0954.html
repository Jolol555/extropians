"Actually, your "semi-mutual agreements" sound an awful lot like coercion<br>

private citizen could run a state based on mutual agreements.  However,<br>
much of the time they are not mutual; by definition, exchanges which are<br>
not mutually agreed upon by all participants are coercive.<br>

I don't seek to make "semi-mutual agreements" more beneficial; rather I<br>

<p>
You are right.  The "semi-mutual agreements" that people currently live<br>
under are forms of coercion.  And yet these agreements have come about by<br>
choice; maybe not on the part of the ones being coerced, but certainly on<br>
the part of the ones coercing (unless they are being coerced to coerce). <br>
And if we really want to end coercion in all forms of human interaction,<br>
then we need to understand why so many millions of individuals so<br>
willingly choose to be coercive.  And keep in mind that coercion goes<br>
beyond government; it happens in families, and it happens on the<br>
playground, and it happens in many other places as well.  Many millions<br>
of people like to boss other people around.  Why?<br>
<p>
We all like to get our way, but many people like to coerce others into<br>
helping them get their way.  And some people just like the feeling of<br>
power they get from having others obey them.  Coercion is a very<br>
widespread phenomenon, and it is a very deep and ingrained part of human<br>
interaction.  It isn't going to be easy to eliminate it.  Getting rid of<br>
governments won't do it; governments are only the products of a coercive<br>
society; the problem is not "government", but the coercive nature of the<br>
society which created and supports government.  It's *individual people*,<br>
working together to force their will on those who won't go along<br>
willingly, that creates government.  *Individuals* are coercive, and they<br>
form coercive groups.  But to eliminate coercion, coercive individuals<br>
must be taught to be non-coercive, and this may take a lot of<br>
psychotherapy, or something similar. If we just eliminate coercive<br>
organizations, like government, coercive individuals will just form other<br>
coercive organizations.  If we're going to stop coercion we must stop it<br>
at it's source; individuals.<br>
<p>
Any ideas how to practically do this?  Self help books? (_Controlling<br>
Coercion_: How Coercive Behavior is Self-Defeating)?  Lots of Internet<br>
sites on the subject, with lots of information on how to eliminate<br>
coercive behavior in oneself?  TV documentaries?  Popularizing discussion<br>
of coercion?<br>
