Yeah, it's called shareware. If you hadn't noticed, it is booming<br>
on the net nowadays. There is even "push" from companies like<br>
Marimba that lets you auto-update your code as needed.<br>
<p>
Most shareware seems to be sticking to the "pay once, use forever"<br>
strategy, but includes a year of updates or something. I'm not<br>
sure at which point (if ever), the authors will move to a pay<br>
per use model even though the technology already exists today<br>
and could be included easily.<br>

<i>&gt; I'm always disturbed when I'm using a piece of software that's flawed in</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious ways and in ways that seriously limit the functionality of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; software or it's ease of use.  I always come up with good ideas for</i><br>
<i>&gt; fixing the problems and am frustrated by the fact that my ideas will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be implemented.  But I have reason to believe this will not be a problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the Internet expands, as bandwidth increases, as e-cash becomes</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard and as trusted systems become widely prevalent, I can foresee</i><br>
<i>&gt; much software being distributed through the Internet on a pay-as-you-use</i><br>
<i>&gt; basis.  The software will likely be component-based software, where each</i><br>
<i>&gt; component could be designed by different programmers, who are paid some</i><br>
<i>&gt; small amount each time their component is used (the cost of using the</i><br>
<i>&gt; software would be the sum of the cost of running the components which are</i><br>
<i>&gt; run).  This would allow someone who sees a flaw in some piece of software</i><br>
<i>&gt; or something they want to add on to improve the software, to make those</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes, and when people use the components that they have added, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be paid for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm sure a lot of companies will still copyright their software and not</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow it to be modified, but I know a lot of people would encourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; others to improve their software.  Of course, then we'd end up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of different versions of one piece of software, at varying</i><br>
<i>&gt; degrees of quality.  This naturally leads to some sort of selection</i><br>
<i>&gt; system; people want to use good software, but they don't have time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; evaluate thousands of different pieces of software.  So they pay people</i><br>
<i>&gt; to do it for them.  I can see Web sites which offer really good software,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a small fee, of course.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Basically, this could allow software to evolve much more than it does</i><br>
<i>&gt; today.  There is a real financial motive for programmers to improve</i><br>
<i>&gt; software, even if they didn't design the original version.  The original</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmers benefit from this public modification of their software since</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of what they wrote (and will get paid for) is unlikely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; modified much in the short term, at least, and any improvements to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; software will only serve to make it more competitive and used more often,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and thus they will get paid more.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The details of how to keep track of who wrote what and how to determine</i><br>
<i>&gt; pricing and how to make it difficult to get around paying for what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; use are somewhat tricky, but I have high confidence that it can, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; will, be done.  I look forward to that time.</i><br>
