Several people have remarked that Dolly is already evidence against any<br>
simple understanding of the role of telomere length.  Here's a salient bit<br>
(quoted without permission) from Gina Kolata's new book CLONE: THE ROAD TO<br>
DOLLY AND THE THE PATH AHEAD (William Morrow 1997; Allen Lane 1997):<br>
<p>
`More than 90 per cent of all the cell divisions that ever occur in an<br>
animal's... life occur in the womb...  If Dolly's telomeres had only a few<br>
divisions to go, she could not possibly have made it through foetal life...<br>
<p>
`...another problem with the telomere hypothesis: Eggs are packed with<br>
enzymes that lengthen telomeres.  [I assume she just means telomerase, and<br>
that this is already in the cytoplasm of the host ovum.  DB]  In fact, one<br>
of the first things eggs do when they are fertilized is to adjust the<br>
lengths of the telomeres on their chromosomes.  So if a clone started out<br>
with telomeres that were too short, it is all but certain that the egg<br>
would lengthen them'  (pp. 204-5).<br>
<p>
Okay, breathe easy for Dolly.  But here's the kicker, something I haven't<br>
read anywhere else:<br>
<p>
`[Lee M.] Silver [of MOUSE GENETICS (OUP 1995) fame] told me that mouse<br>
researchers have even created mice that do not have [telomerase].  The mice<br>
seemed healthy... are now up their fourth generation [sans telomerase]...<br>
yet to find anything wrong...' (p. 205).<br>
<p>
Hmm.<br>
