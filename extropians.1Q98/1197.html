<i>&gt;&gt; From:          "Peter C. McCluskey" &lt;pcm@rahul.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Linux is an example of a free non-market non-capitalist solution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What you say about Linux is true except for the claim that it is </i><br>
<i>&gt;non-market and non-capitalist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Linux does compete in a market both for users against other operating </i><br>
<i>&gt;systems, and for programmers against other programming projects.</i><br>
<p>
 Only if you stretch the word market well beyond its original meaning<br>
of a place where people buy and sell things (i.e. make it synonymous<br>
with a free system, in which case the word market doesn't serve much<br>
purpose).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And the capital is essential to its effort.  It happens to be almost </i><br>
<i>&gt;entirely human capital -- something nobody but libertarians and </i><br>
<p>
 Which would still exist in a free non-propertarian system, which most<br>
people wouldn't think of as capitalist.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;What would happen if people went against the conditions of use (or</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever it is you see that's pasted all over linux when you first come</i><br>
<i>&gt;across it)?</i><br>
<p>
 Not much. The violater would get harrased a bit, and wouldn't derive<br>
much benefit from the violation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;He means that linux has not been made free by a political process but by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the free decision of those involved.  Perhaps "capitalism" and "market"</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't quite precisely what's being pointed out here, but certainly a</i><br>
<i>&gt;classical liberal or libertarian system of property rights is presupposed.</i><br>
<p>
 How would Linux be different if there were no property rights for<br>
information?<br>

<i>&gt;Coase's work makes that completely irrelevant.  In a sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt;free market with sufficiently low tansaction costs, the optimal</i><br>
<i>&gt;result will be found /regardless of initial distribution/.  So why</i><br>
<i>&gt;whine about how anyone came to own things originally?  It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter; what matters is working on reducing transaction costs.</i><br>
<p>
 a) reducing transaction costs is hard; and<br>
 b) Coase only proved that the result would have optimal efficiency;<br>
 most people use a broader notion of optimality which includes some<br>
 measure of how much property they own.<br>
