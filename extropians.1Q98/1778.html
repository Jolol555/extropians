<i>&gt; I may be speaking against the extropian principle of "dynamic optimism"</i><br>
<i>&gt; but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think "dynamic realism" would do the faithful better. No one can</i><br>
<i>&gt; honestly</i><br>
<i>&gt; deny the environmental devestation we have wrecked on the planet, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; many</i><br>
<i>&gt; species we have driven to extinction, global warming, pollution, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; cancer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't shrug that off as being "doom and gloom". It's reality like it</i><br>
<i>&gt; or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And as I receall, even Simon didn't say destroying Nature was a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing.</i><br>

You are right that Julian Simon never said that destroying nature was a good <br>
thing, but who is saying that?<br>
<p>
Julian Simon was a man who was always concerned about the facts. He never denied <br>
things that were true and he never denied the negative things humans have done <br>
(like pollution and killing off some species), but he always pointed out that, in <br>
general and in almost all specifics, things are getting better for human beings.<br>
<p>
The facts are that life expectency is increasing, death rates are decreasing, <br>
poverty is decreasing, standards of living are increasing, birth rates are <br>
decreasing, prices of resources are decreasing, the forested areas of the U.S. <br>
are increasing, air quality is improving, etc., etc. Of course, there are <br>
problems, but the trends are encouraging across the board. That is reality.<br>
<p>
In contrast, Paul Ehrlich continually insists doomsday is just around the corner <br>
unless we adopt all sorts of authoritarian government controls. When his <br>
predictions don't come true (and he has made so many bad predictions that he <br>
makes the Psychic Hotline look good!), he moves back the date of doomsday or he <br>
claims that he helped avert the catastrophe. <br>
