<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; But my original point was that there is a difference between morality and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; legality -- or what is right and wrong and what should be up to the law --</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; whether enforced by a government or what have you -- to decide.  Does</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; anyone agree with me on this?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;The government, if it exists, should only enforce laws to protect people's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;liberty and property and make sure contracts are enforced. However, under our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;current legal system, acts which are not immoral, like taking drugs are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;criminalized, while theft by the government (taxation), certainly immoral, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;quite legal. Ideally, everything immoral should be illegal, and everything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;should be legal. I am however, speaking of rational morality, not the often</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;idiotic kind advanced by religion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;For an example of immorality posing as morality, see the truly vile piece</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by Dr.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;Sally Satel (an evil psychiatrist) in today's Wall Street Journal advocating</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;using coercion against drug users "for their own good." It's a shame this Nazi</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;bitch is given space in one of our leading newspapers, but the WSJ is run by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;bunch of superstitious religious conservatives who have no idea of the real</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;meaning of freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Mark conflates morality and law.  I believe the two are distinct.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; acts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which are immoral which should not be illegal, such as smoking.  Smoking is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; self-destructive -- yet it should not be outlawed.  Under a rational morality,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; smoking would be wrong, but no police officer would come knocking at your</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; door if you smoked.  Ditto for overeating, lack of exercise, most drug use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Rational morality cannot be forced.  It must be spread by persuasion.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; only time force can be used is when someone initiates or threatens to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; initiate force.  Then it is just a matter of defense or just retaliation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Correct. Law should only be applicable to cases where one individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; hurts another in some way without consent. Every person should have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to do whatever one wants with oneself, no matter how immoral, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; only with others with their consent. THis is what I find so ironic about</i><br>
<i>&gt; religious people trying to legislate morality. If a person has no legal</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice but to be moral, where is the virtue??? Virtue comes from making</i><br>
<i>&gt; the concious choice for being good, which can only occur if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual is totally free to choose either way.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree that "vices" such as smoking, drinking, whoring around, etc. <br>
are immoral. To me a virtuous persion is someone who doesn't coerce, <br>
harm or cheat others. <br>
<p>
Who's the moral person in this example?<br>
<p>
1. Mr. A. He never drinks, smokes, overeats or has sex but has just <br>
embezzled $50,000 from his company. <br>
<p>
2. Mr. B. He  smokes, drinks, overeats and goes to hookers every night, <br>
but has not embezzled $50,000 from his company.<br>
<p>
Religious people are not really trying to legislate morality. They are <br>
really acting immorally in trying to force their personal preferences on <br>
others.<br>
