<i>&gt;&gt; IAN: Your effort is to equate Hitler responding</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; to consumers with better washing machines. It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a shell game. The difference that your analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; obscures is that one set of responses are acts</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of aggression and the other are acts of service.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The analysis doesn't have to take the 'act' into count, at no time</i><br>
<i>&gt;have we appended "with agression" to the definition of "centralised."</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: An analysis that does not take <br>
  the nature of the things analyzed into <br>
  account is not much of an analysis. If<br>
  we fail to observe that free markets are <br>
  different than Nazism, we'll probably end <br>
  up with National Socialism. Your saying <br>
  that we don't need to take X into account<br>
  is asking us to fail to observe difference.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The response by Hitler is an effort to suppress</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; control by the many, the response of suppliers </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to consumers accepts control by the many. Your</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; trying to make "the different" "the same as."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Many acts of "acceptance" and "supression" would be commited by either</i><br>
<i>&gt;a Nazi dictator or a supplier. I'm sure the average CEO takes many</i><br>
<i>&gt;decisions that could be considered to "supress control of the many"</i><br>
<i>&gt;and I'm sure Hitler made many changes to his plans due to the will of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the people.</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: The effort to equate the free-market<br>
  supplier with Hitler seems to be an effort<br>
  to demolish the truth and misrepresent the<br>
  free market. Right off-the-bat I can tell<br>
  you that there is a difference between <br>
  Sears and Hitler. Why someone should<br>
  want to obscure that difference <br>
  seems rather suspect to me.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; So what's your (central) plan for decentralization?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We should all strive to be in the centre.</i><br>
<p>
  IAN: Well that's what suppliers try <br>
  to do by supplying the best products. So <br>
  the market fits your ideal decentralization.<br>
