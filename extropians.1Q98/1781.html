Julian Simon enters the ranks of those terrible losses among whom I would<br>
include recently Carl Sagan. I had discussed life extension and cryonics<br>
with Julian a couple of times. In one of his letters he signed off with the<br>
name "Senior Junior", having some fun in the spirit of adopting Extropian<br>
names. When I talked to him by phone and asked about this, he confirmed my<br>
interpretation that it implied he was old by traditional standards but<br>
young by Extropian standards.<br>
<p>
Despite this indication that he might be becoming sympathetic to life<br>
extension, he always resisted the desirability of living longer. I wonder<br>
whether it was due to being tired of a long struggle with depression. If<br>
you read his book "Good Mood" you will learn that he has fought depression<br>
for a long time. The impression I got was that he didn't take medication<br>
for it, instead entirely relying on psychological approaches to controlling<br>
it. This is only speculation, but I suspect that his struggle may have<br>
blunted an interest in life extension that might otherwise have blossomed.<br>
Certainly he was sympathetic to extropian thinking and expected the future<br>
to be better than the past.<br>
<p>
What can we do to try to prevent death from claiming many more of our<br>
intellectual pioneers?<br>
<p>
Julian Simon will always exist in my thoughts, but I wish that wasn't all.<br>
