<i>&gt; I just finished James Halperin's "The First Immortal", and to be</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would love to start a discussion on it, but I guess I'll wait a</i><br>
<i>&gt; couple of weeks to avoid spoiling...... (get it?)</i><br>
<p>
I liked it a lot, too, and in fact I started reading it again right after<br>
I had finished it the first time.  However my son is reading it now so I<br>
didn't finish my re-read.<br>
<p>
One of the big problems in any 21st century SF which incorporates nanotech<br>
and similar advances is how to avoid the Singularity - the acceleration of<br>
advancement into a pace so furious that the world becomes unrecognizable.<br>
It appears that Halperin has no more than postponed the Singularity, as<br>
it looks unlikely to me that humanity will come out of his 22nd century<br>
in any kind of recognizable form.<br>
<p>
Halperin has a couple of tricks to slow the rate of technology advance.<br>
One is to put restrictions on AI research.  Some early AI machines become<br>
aggressive and kill people, and after that they are not supposed to be<br>
programmed with emotions or survival instincts.  They're just a bunch of<br>
Vulcan types.  They do become much smarter than humans over the course<br>
of the 21st century, but presumably these restrictions do limit their<br>
rate of advance.<br>
<p>
The other magic which Halperin has up his sleeve is his Truth Machine.<br>
This was the subject of his first novel, which I haven't read.  The device<br>
is a foolproof lie detector, and it allows laws to be enforced with a<br>
certainty far beyond anything which would be reasonable today.<br>
<p>
Once there is a world government armed with the truth machine, they<br>
can pass laws restricting access to nanotech (and presumably any other<br>
destabilizing technologies) and be sure they are enforced.  This prevents<br>
various technology runaway scenarios, both good and bad.<br>
<p>
Not having read the first novel, I find the potential for abuse with a<br>
truth machine very troubling.  It is presented in almost purely beneficial<br>
terms, but obviously it could be misused as well.  The idea reminds me<br>
somewhat of David Brin's "transparent society", where you have a Big<br>
Brother-like monitoring system, but it's OK because the people doing the<br>
monitoring get monitored, too.  The danger is that if an evil person somehow<br>
got into power, he'd be able to use these technologies to maintain his<br>
power very effectivelly.  No revolt or rebellion could be hidden.<br>
<p>
In effect this kind of technology is a power amplifier.  Whoever has the<br>
bulk of power in society can use this to enforce their will.  If the mass<br>
of people ultimately has the power, then in many ways the truth machine<br>
will be beneficial, as they can prevent evil people from seizing power<br>
away from them.  On the other hand, where the masses misuse their power,<br>
there won't be the limitations on their abilities that we have today.<br>
The majority of people in the United States believes in conventional<br>
religious morality, but if it wants to legislate on that basis, in<br>
practice it can't control people's private lives very well.  A truth<br>
machine would change that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see it is in development as an upcoming mini-series, if done</i><br>
<i>&gt; properly, IMMHO it could change the future of cryonics.</i><br>
<p>
I'm a little skeptical about this, having seen many efforts fail in the<br>
past which were going to change the future of cryonics.  For example,<br>
Omni magazine had a reasonably well promoted contest where the prize was<br>
"immortality" - a cryonic suspension contract with Alcor.  This was a<br>
big jump into the mainstream, especially with the idea of cryonics as<br>
a prize, a reward, not some kooky perversion.  However it was not much<br>
of a success; there weren't many entries, and I think most people were<br>
just not ready for it.<br>
<p>
I thought Halperin's novel was most effective in depicting a 21st century<br>
where we'd like to live, and where technology really does advance to<br>
the point where it solves many of our most difficult problems.  I was<br>
uncomfortable when it took on a scolding tone, shaking its head over how<br>
blind people were in the late 20th century not to sign up for cryonics.<br>
This reminds me too much of a temperance tract regaling us with the<br>
evils of Demon Alcohol.<br>
<p>
Science fiction authors often succumb to the temptation to have their<br>
future characters talk about the mistakes of the 20th century - if<br>
only they'd taken care of the environment, or if only they'd been more<br>
socialist, no, if only they'd been more capitalist, etc.  I never find<br>
this realistic (how much time do we spend talking about the mistakes of<br>
the 1890's?), and even when it does fit, I don't necessarily think the<br>
future characters are right (people today disagree over the morality<br>
of the "robber barons" of the 19th century, even with 100 years of<br>
hindsight).<br>
<p>
Halperin doesn't overdo this, fortunately.  If his novel is a success<br>
then it probably will help to make cryonics more acceptable.  But I<br>
suspect that it will be many years before it becomes truly mainstream.<br>
