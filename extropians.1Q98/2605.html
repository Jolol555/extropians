At least in the U.S., it is a felony to participate in a conspiracy. If<br>
you make<br>
an exhortation in an e-mail that somebody else do simething illegal, and<br>
the person enetes into a discussion with and subsequently performs that<br>
illegal act, then you have technically committed conspiracy. I'm less<br>
clear<br>
on whether or not the other participants in the discussion are also guilty<br>
<p>
of consciracy, but they might be. In light of this, please hold such<br>
discussions<br>
only among those who wish to be involved. Thanks.<br>
