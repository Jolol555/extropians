Some VLCC's are larger than 500,000 dwt, but the economics are even worse  <br>
than what you say. For their size supertankers are the cheapest ships on the <br>
sea, partly because they're poorly made and designed to last only a few years, <br>
but mostly because they're nothing but floating oil tanks. To convert such a <br>
hulk into a ship capable of carrying lots of people could easily cost 10 <br>
times as much.  If you were low on machine guns and thus expected people to <br>
make the ship their home voluntarily then you'd have to make it somewhat more <br>
comfortable than a slave ship, and that would cost at least 100 times as much <br>
and probably much more.<br>
    <br>
Even if these economic problems could be overcome we'd still only exist at <br>
the whim of the superpowers, if we were not good little boys they'd send a <br>
torpedo up our ass and sink the ship so fast it'd bounce off the bottom. <br>
I think countries suck and there are too many of them already, and I think <br>
David Musick got it exactly right when he said:  <br>
<p>
 "Aren't we *beyond* thinking of countries in terms of land area? Is't it   <br>
  more realistic to think of countries in terms of organization,   <br>
  communication and resource movement? [...] I see the idea of a "country"   <br>
  as a relic from a dying age, as global economics blurrs and erases national   <br>
  borders."                                         <br>
