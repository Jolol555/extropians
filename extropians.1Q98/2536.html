<i>&gt; OBLIGATION to help others means I am, in effect, a slave.</i><br>
<p>
Having obligations (family, social groups, community, state, nation, foreigners, etc.),<br>
doesn't make one a slave, it make one responsible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I do not accept any fault for the results of dictatorships thousands of miles away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
At what distance should a person take responsiblity for trying to stop or mitigate the<br>
actions of ruthless dictatorships?  Or, do you have a limit on how many people should die or<br>
suffer at the hands of a dictatorship thousands of miles away, before a person should feel<br>
responsible to act?  In this day and age, I picture the Earth as a small, vulnerable,<br>
lifeboat where distance and numbers are irrelavent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And what exactly are you proposing we should do to help these poor souls</i><br>
<i>&gt; in third world hell holes?</i><br>
<p>
I am proposing that each of us does what they can in their own way (even writing e-mails at<br>
1229 AM while their wife waits in bed), and if the people who had true power in the developed<br>
world thought about and spent a little money, they could do alot more than what is being done<br>
now.  Again, how much is saving an Ethiopian worth?  If we all gave a dollar....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should the U.S. attempt an invasion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire continent of Africa? Are you going to sign up for this? Or are we</i><br>
<i>&gt; just supposed to send more bags of food and money over with no assurance</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it will ever get to those in need?</i><br>
<p>
A definition of insanity is to continue to do what doesn't work.  If at first you don't<br>
succeed...<br>
