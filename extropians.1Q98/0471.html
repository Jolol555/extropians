<i>&gt; application we're discussing, the useful energy is low-intensity</i><br>
<i>&gt; heat, which is the easiest goal to reach.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
You must recover enough high quality energy to operate your device. So<br>
far,<br>
all fusion devices need a lot of high quality energy.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; It's not proven that SL is blackbody rediation and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; indicative of near-fusion conditions, and the phenomenon is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not well enough understood to find a useful set of conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; whereby you can extract useful energy: currently, SL is observed</i><br>
<i>&gt; only at temperatured near the freezing point of water. Don't count</i><br>
<i>&gt; on SL for micro-fusion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
An announcement in Photonics Spectra (photonics trade magazine) stated<br>
that<br>
a supercomputer simulation of SL, with the right kind of driving pulses<br>
could<br>
reach fusion temperatures.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I envision an D-D fusion reactor based on a form of inertial-confinement</i><br>
<i>&gt; fusion, using a truly tiny holraum and starting in an environment with</i><br>
<i>&gt; very high static pressure. The environment is the center of a set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; diamondoid spheres, each of which contributes a megapascal or so of</i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure differential. </i><br>
<p>
Your geometry won't work. Each shell must be larger than the previous<br>
one. In the end your maximum strength is no larger than that of the bulk<br>
material.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The D-D reaction emits no primary neutrons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The innermost sphere brings the interior static pressure up to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; highest level that remains consistent with diamondiod nanotech and</i><br>
<i>&gt; diamondoid compressive and tensile strength. The nanotech machinery</i><br>
<i>&gt; contained within the inner shell then delivers a transient implosive</i><br>
<i>&gt; pulse to the holraum (mechanically, or with lasers, or with explosives)</i><br>
<i>&gt; to cause fusion. </i><br>
<p>
I rather suspect that nanotech becomes quite limited at high pressures.<br>
At extremely high pressures the forces of chemical bonds are of the same<br>
magnitude and you just can't build nanotech.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This geherates a lot of heat, raising the temperature</i><br>
<i>&gt; of th interior. The reactor uses the thermal gradient from inside to</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside to capture the energy neeeded to drive the next pulse.</i><br>
<p>
High pressure and temperature only reinforce my point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Agreed. Given nano, you can get very efficient in every way. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular, forget the tent. Just reconfigure your body's resident </i><br>
<i>&gt; clothing nanos to provide an insulating skin of the type you describe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Tents are nice, they provide privacy. Of course your clothing could<br>
reconfigure into a tent.<br>
<p>
BTW, I think a "mister fusion" is like backpacking a Winnebago...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some elements capture neutrons very efficiently, but I want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; start with a reaction that doesn't emit neutrons at all. </i><br>
<p>
Ok. You have: Neutrons, skip those. Ok, energetic alphas - still capable<br>
of considerable nano mayhem. (and you gotta have alphas, ok?). Then<br>
there's betas, which have a range of inches, at least. OH, and I forgot<br>
the gammas, with a range of several feet even in rock.... Nice device<br>
you have here...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; So, how do you catch these anyway??</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's not a percentage of neutrons, that's a percentage of waste atoms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; you catch the atoms by recognizing that they are atoms of elements</i><br>
<i>&gt; (heavy metals) that don't belong here.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Just a logical argument here. Either you catch them (and separate them)<br>
or you don't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It doesn't have to be efficient. It doesn't even have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; break even. It just has to be able to bust up these ugly big</i><br>
<i>&gt; radioactive isotopes that are not amenable to destruction by other</i><br>
<i>&gt; means.</i><br>
<p>
Using precious high quality energy here. I can see it now. 100 KW, of<br>
which<br>
we budget 10 KW to run the Mr Fusion, and 10 KW to run the accelerator,<br>
with<br>
80 KW of waste heat!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The problem is that for esthetic and political reasons we want this</i><br>
<i>&gt; tiny accelerator to be contained within the "mister fusion" housing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What I'm banking on here is a major deux ex machina, even worse than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the inertial confinement system above: There are ways to use lasers</i><br>
<i>&gt; to pump energy into a particle beam with extreme efficiency, yielding</i><br>
<i>&gt; a very high change in Mev per meter of acelerator. </i><br>
<p>
Catch is the efficiency of making dose laser beams. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I further assume that</i><br>
<i>&gt; an accelerator built via nanotech to atomic precision can achieve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearly the theoretical efficiency limit.</i><br>
<p>
Gotcha on this one! The nucleus is 10^5 times smaller than the atom. No<br>
way can you create this precision with nanotech.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This should permit each nasty</i><br>
<i>&gt; heavy radioneucleotide atom to be bashed with extreme precision into</i><br>
<i>&gt; little pieces that are more tractable, all (I hope) in an accelerator</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's less than a meter long.</i><br>
<p>
And you expect all those random flying bashed pieces to be nice? hah!<br>
