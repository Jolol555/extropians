<p>
We can grow virtually any crop plant hydroponically - with nothing<br>
but water, nitrates, and a couple specific salts.  We do indeed <br>
know that the plants we depend on do great in the compete absence<br>
of any biodiversity and external biochemistry.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;rate at which that same land can't grow again without the introduction </i><br>
<i>&gt;of ever greater and more potent fertilizers.  </i><br>
<p>
No, it's not that yields are dropping or are going to drop, it's<br>
that to maintain the yields we have to keep dumping in nitrogen.<br>
In some circumstances, our yield are approaching economic maximum<br>
in that adding more nitrogen won't help any.  But current nitrogen<br>
additions will keep crop yields going indefinitely, from the <br>
fertilizer side.  The main potential problem right now is salinization,<br>
which biodiversity won't help with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Besides, the destructiion of biodiversity is not a very extropian thing </i><br>

<i>&gt;about increasing complexity?</i><br>
<p>
No, it's more about increasing value (in the abstract, not the <br>
economic sense).  Complexity may or may not be a good thing.<br>
<p>
If your claim is that maintaining biodiversity is a good thing, I've<br>
no disagreement with that.  But it's not *necessary* for our <br>
continued existance as a complex, interesting, populous community.<br>
