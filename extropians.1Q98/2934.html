<i>&gt; Of course it's a silly example.  But *why* is it a silly example, i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; why isn't Brazil also an economic powerhouse?</i><br>
<p>
Probably because like most subject nations Brazil was seen as a<br>
source of raw materials, and thus took quite some time to develop<br>
an industrial base, whereas the US overthrew colonial power early<br>
on in the piece and was forced to develop a native industrial<br>
base.  I'd say population has something to do with it, too,<br>
although I'm totally clueless when it comes to the comparative<br>
population, so I may be talking out of my hat on this one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I like to think it's not *only* military power that makes Americana</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What on earth makes you think "americana" is *fashionable*??</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; American military prowess and money are *desired* around the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; world, but "fashionable" "americana"??</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Okay, so it's just my imagination that the whole world drinks Coke and</i><br>
<i>&gt; watches Baywatch.</i><br>
<p>
It's easy to compete internationally when you have already<br>
recouped development costs and turned a profit from domestic<br>
sales alone. And I would say there is more to a way of life than<br>
coke and baywatch.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I find it amusing in the extreme that a collection of people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; declare themselves anti-statist are defending the US so</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vigorously...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Every state is evil, but ours is - or was - among the least evil.</i><br>
<p>
I'd definitely pick -was- out of those two choices.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not as big a fan as Mike Lorrey, though. </i><br>
<p>
You'd have to work hard at it, I feel. And those blinkers start<br>
to chafe after a while<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it was he who</i><br>
<i>&gt; pointed out that the USA did not take advantage of WW2 to pursue</i><br>
<i>&gt; territorial expansion; that may be because the courts might make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; government treat its new subjects like citizens -- much more convenient</i><br>
<i>&gt; to occupy them as "military advisors" and/or rule through puppets.</i><br>
<p>
Even more convenient to do away with the overheads of occupation<br>
and rule and extract just as much money from unfair trade as you<br>
could have via tribute.<br>
<p>
I think this is by far the cleverest thing the US has done:<br>
instead of maintaining huge standing armies and colonial<br>
administration, with the associated costs, simply ensure that<br>
your domestic companies are the dominant players in the market<br>
and suck money out that way. bingo, all the benefits of an empire<br>
and none of the disadvantages.<br>
