The main problem being that perhaps different experiences are frequently<br>
confused or wrongly organized in a vertical hierarchy ,although they<br>
are  completely different phenomena. It's interesting to notice that<br>
Timothy Leary created the circuits theory in the 70's, and simply forgot<br>
it during the following years (the circuits came back with "Design for<br>
dying", but, for various reasons,  this book is atypical).<br>
There is apparently a "rapture" experience, which can be summarized by<br>
the loss of the sensation of body's limits. This can be expressed as an<br>
"out of the body experience", as a disappearing of the body (yoga), or<br>
as a fusion between the body and environment. I'm not sure this can be<br>
categorized as a superior circuit or state of consciousness, but it's<br>
fun , and gives certainly good results against stress and on body's<br>
health.<br>
The metaprogramming experience, that Leary names the sixth circuit could<br>
be a completely different experience. I find it closer to ethological<br>
mechanism of "insight", or, even better, to the Gregory Bateson's<br>
concept "learning III". According Bateson, Learning I is the simple,<br>
traditional, learning. Learning II (learning to learn) is the process<br>
that, frequently through "insight", one can build a model of the world<br>
based on previous experience (the monkey sees banana; the monkey sees<br>
the rod; suddenly, the monkey has a mystical flash and takes the banana<br>
with the rod; he just created a new model of the world, where things can<br>
be used as tools). Leaning III (learning to learn to learn) is a more<br>
complex experience where one's own model of the world is seen as a<br>
relative reality, and can therefore be changed. This is the mystical<br>
crisis, the conversion process, the Zen's satori.<br>
The two states, the "rapture" and the "satori" are frequently confused<br>
because the rapture experience can be so shocking that it can lead to a<br>
mystical crisis, at least on the first time. On the other side, a very<br>
intense satori, which "deconstructs" one's world model, can lead to a<br>
state of rapture (because the body's limits are also a psychological<br>
construction).<br>
The difference between the rapture and the satori can be an explanation<br>
of the fundamental difference between hindu and buddhic mysticism. The<br>
first assumes that the highest rapture state (samadhi) is an expression<br>
of reality, but buddhists claims that one can only understand reality<br>
through awakening or crisis, rapture states being just a tool. As it is<br>
easier to experiment rapture than awakening, the confusion between the<br>
states began also to invade buddhism, until the "revolt" of the Rinzai<br>
Zen masters, who chose to abandon the rapture way to awakening to use<br>
instead a kind of shock therapy through violent or absurd behavior.<br>
