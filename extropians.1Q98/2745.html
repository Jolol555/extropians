Or 26,000 miles from the surface.  Still just a bright dot passing through the<br>
night sky.<br>
<p>
It is interesting to note that small asteroids pass closer than the moon<br>
regularly, almost once per year in recent years if I read the data from the<br>
Harvard-Smithsonian CfA correctly.  <br>
<p>
Perhaps this will be a good chance to test an asteroid defense vehicle, after<br>
the rock passes.  Nuclear bomb or other propulsion based, we ought to test a<br>
system for the purpose.  Perhaps public concern over this one could be used to<br>
pry funding from the politicians, perhaps for SDIO or NASA.<br>
<p>
I wish people would list the relative velocity for these objects the way they<br>
mention diameter, there is considerable variation in orbital velocity for<br>
asteroids, yes?  Impact energy would go up with the square of the velocity and<br>
the cube of the diameter, obviously.<br>
