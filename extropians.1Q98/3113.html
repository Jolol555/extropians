I want to make a claim on the FX site (the current name for the game<br>
based on Robin Hanson's Idea Futures) about quantum computing.  There<br>
is nothing there now except insofar as it would affect some of the<br>
factoring and other crypto claims.<br>
<p>
I need to define what is meant by a quantum computer, set a minimum of<br>
performance and capacity, and choose a date.  People will then bet on<br>
whether such a machine will exist by the specified date.<br>
<p>
The quantum computer's capacity can be measured in qubits, which are<br>
capable of being put into a superposition of two states.  It also needs<br>
to have one or more operators which can change the states of the bits.<br>
The operators have to be "universal" in the sense that any possible<br>
logical operation can be created by combining the operators appropriately.<br>
<p>
It also needs to be possible to prepare the qubits in a desired initial<br>
state, and to read the state of at least some of them at the end of the<br>
operation.<br>
<p>
The computer's performance will be limited by noise and by coherence time.<br>
Operations will not be perfectly reliable due to noise, and over time,<br>
interactions with the environment will also destroy the coherence of<br>
the quantum superpositions.  These can be addressed to some extent by<br>
using quantum error correction.<br>
<p>
My idea is to specify some minimum number of logical qubits, perhaps<br>
about 50, and some minimum number of operations which can be done by<br>
the computer before coherence is lost.  Doing error correction requires<br>
redundancy, and so more than 50 actual qubits may be needed in order to<br>
give the effect of 50 logical bits.  I don't have a good sense for how<br>
many operations would be a good target, or even how to count operations<br>
since different machines may have operators with differing amounts<br>
of power.<br>
<p>
Another approach would be to require successfully factoring a 50 bit<br>
number using Shor's algorithm or some improvement.  I'm a little worried<br>
though that someone would claim that since the quantum computer is allowed<br>
to be aided by a non-quantum computer (which I think actually happens<br>
in Shor's algorithm) and since factoring 50 bit values is trivial on an<br>
ordinary computer, they might argue that the claim was already satisfied.<br>
Some players delight in finding loopholes in claims, although I think<br>
it ruins the game.<br>
<p>
Looking at some of the recent work,<br>
<a href="http://p23.lanl.gov/Quantum/quantum.html">http://p23.lanl.gov/Quantum/quantum.html</a><br>
it is pretty amazing what is happening in this field.  I have been<br>
skeptical about quantum computing, but the pieces appear to be falling<br>
into place.  I am thinking of a 5 year target for the 50 qubit computer.<br>
Does that seem too short?  If so I might reduce the number of qubits to<br>
keep the claim within a reasonably short time frame.<br>
<p>
Any comments or suggestions are most welcome!<br>
<p>
