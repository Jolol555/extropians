<p>
Of course they do...  but all of these happen to be forms of investment.  :)  <br>
<p>
Students invest money now in their education so as to be able to get<br>
greater returns on their human capital later, eventually paying off their<br>
scholastic investment.  Corporations invest in their infrastructure now to<br>
get greater productivity, eventually paying off their corporate investment.<br>
 Laborers sacrifice wages now in the hopes of increasing the wage rate,<br>
eventually recompensing them for their losses during the strike.  All come<br>
in the form of private investment.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I think having some sort of 'support system' increases the stability of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;society </i><br>
<p>
While stability cannot be measured, I would agree with you that a support<br>
system does increase stability.  However, stability and growth may not be<br>
related; they may even share an inverse relationship.<br>
<p>
Remember, the only investment which actually improves growth is that which<br>
(at least) pays for itself.  When a so-called "safety net" is in place, it<br>
may decrease somewhat the incentive to make certain that investments pay<br>
for themselves.  Some economists argue that this is exactly what has caused<br>
the economic crash in Asia:  governments were investing in social welfare<br>
projects (and sometimes lining their own pockets) which don't pay for<br>
themselves.  Investments of this sort hurt the economy rather than help it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;because there's no 'underclass' that has nothing to lose. </i><br>
<p>
Isn't that part of the point of a safety net/support system?  Making it so<br>
people have nothing to lose?  (while still having something?)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then the problem becomes to quantify 'good-in-the-short-run' and</i><br>
<i>&gt;'bad-in-the-long-run'. Is the technical/economic progress gained in 5,10 or</i><br>
<i>&gt;50 years from now worth abandoning welfare now and letting a part of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;population slide down to extreme poverty, disease (or maybe starvation)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can we attach numbers to these values somehow? So how much technical</i><br>
<i>&gt;progress is a human life or human suffering worth these days?</i><br>
<p>
These are good questions.  Here's my unsubstantiated thoughts on the matter:<br>
<p>
The first possibility, already mentioned, is to turn off the welfare<br>
program now and never look back.  Other tactics, such as leaving welfare at<br>
its current dollar value and never again increasing it for inflation, might<br>
be a better way to go about it, but in this case we leave the transition to<br>
economic forces beyond our control.  A supply shock of any kind during this<br>
period could easily crush the poor.<br>
<p>
Another strategy might be to just leave welfare in place until mind<br>
uploading and/or other immortalizing technologies become affordable to<br>
everyone (or at least subsidizable).  That way, when we did finally shut<br>
down welfare, no one would die as a result.<br>
<p>
While this seems more appealing at first, keep in mind the costs of<br>
implementing this solution: unless/until we develop these technologies,<br>
EVERYONE is going to die, no matter how much they make annually.  If<br>
anything, it seems we should take our foot off the brakes NOW so as to<br>
reach immortality as quickly as possible, if our goal is to minimize death.<br>
<p>
Ah, well.  Hope I've contributed well to the debate.<br>
