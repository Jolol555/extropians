Um, there are some falacies creeping in here ...<br>
<p>
There are, 'less I'm mistaken, three policies for punishment in most<br>
societies: deterrence, revenge, and prevention. These are usually applied<br>
in combination, rather than in isolation, and the mechanism by which <br>
they are applied, and severity, varies.<br>
<p>
Firstly, deterrence. This is pretty much disproven as an approach to<br>
preventing crime; punishment doesn't deter criminals because criminals<br>
don't expect to be caught and punished. If they did, they wouldn't<br>
commit crimes. The classic study of this problem was conducted in England<br>
in the victorian period. The death penalty by hanging was carried out in<br>
public until roughly 1860, when executions were moved indoors. A study<br>
in the 1860's and 1870's demonstrated that something like 95% of criminals<br>
condemned to death had, however, witnessed a public execution for the very<br>
crime they wer to hang for. The deterrent had failed, in their cases. (We<br>
don't know how many people _were_ deterred, of course, but there are other<br>
studies of countries which abolished the death penalty and didn't experience<br>
a sudden surge in the murder rate that suggest the same principle applies.)<br>
<p>
Arguably this is due to incorrect risk evaluation on the part of the<br>
criminally inclined; here in the UK there's a massive program of placing<br>
CCTV cameras in public places, and it does indeed appear to have a major<br>
impact on petty crime (vandalism, car theft, muggings) in public places<br>
overlooked by cameras. The point being that the punishment doesn't deter<br>
criminals; it's the certainly of capture that deters them.<br>
<p>
Secondly, there's revenge. I am not going to try to justify revenge; I<br>
think it's a ridiculous, obscene and unpleasant notion that degrades <br>
everybody involved. An argument for a judicial system based on revenge<br>
is an argument for barbarism. (The whole point of law is to enable people<br>
to coexist peacably without infringing each other's rights. Revenge<br>
doesn't damp down imbalances in the observation of rights; it just<br>
tips the balance the other way.)<br>
<p>
Thirdly, there's prevention. Locking people who break laws up for long<br>
periods of time may or may not be appropriate, but in some cases it may<br>
be the most appropriate way to prevent them re-offending. It has the big<br>
advantage (over captial punishment) that if you discover after you've<br>
locked someone up that they were innocent, you can let them out and try<br>
to provide some kind of compensation. But imprisonment is still an<br>
after-the-fact approach to prevention. The best approach to crime and<br>
punishment would be one that aims to prevent crimes being comitted in<br>
the first place by diverting or defusing criminal impulses (and<br>
minimising the number of spurious or victimless crimes on the statutes,<br>
of course). And I think the best way to do this is probably some sort of<br>
polycentric, open, surveillance society -- Neighbourhood Watch with CCTV<br>
writ large, so that everyone participates in crime prevention (meaning<br>
there are no authoritarian figures in a privileged position to police<br>
society) and everyone knows that it's very difficult to commit a crime<br>
and get away undetected.<br>
<p>
But first, of course, we need to figure out what constitutes a crime, and<br>
what constitutes a welfare program for police officers.<br>
<p>
Any opinions ...?<br>
