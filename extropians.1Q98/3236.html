I wonder if this is going to have an impact on the posthuman movement?<br>
<p>
Imagine a culture of people who are inherently afraid of computers and don't<br>
trust them. This could seriously divide the culture into two LARGE groups of<br>
people. Those who trust and use computers despite what happened and those who<br>
can't be bothered by the machines which ruined their family, business ,credit<br>
rating, social security or whatever..<br>
<p>
Would this slow down our march towards the singularity or somehow accelerate<br>
it??<br>

<i>&gt; Would any customer go to a grocery store where they can't use their debit</i><br>

<i>&gt; where the customer is sent away empty-handed because the business can't</i><br>
