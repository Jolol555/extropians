A fascinating radio broadcast in Australia last night (Tues March 24) with<br>
James Lovelock, inventor of the Gaia hypothesis.  He was interviewed by a<br>
very intelligent autodidact named Phillip Adams.  I missed half the<br>
program, but was astounded to hear Lovelock's claim that after his<br>
unpatented invention (in the '50s? ' 40s?) of the microwave oven - or at<br>
least of using microwaves to thaw frozen stuff - certain researchers in the<br>
'50s successfully revived small frozen mammals by that method.  <br>
<p>
How pristine the animals' neurology was and how long they lasted after<br>
revival wasn't made clear, but Lovelock was explicit about their chilly<br>
temporary state - frozen hamsters, he said, were quite solid; you could<br>
knock them against the lab bench.  After thawing, they'd run around.  <br>
<p>
I have a lot of respect for Lovelock's integrity and ingenuity.  Yet this<br>
claim appears to surpass anything that current cryonics specialists seem<br>
able to replicate.  <br>
<p>
It would be useful to hear some informed comments from, say, Paul Wakfer or<br>
other knowledgeable suspension enthusiasts.<br>
