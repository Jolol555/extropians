In a message dated 98-03-06 15:39:12 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I think it is fine to help those in need. However, to say that I have an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  OBLIGATION to help others means I am, in effect, a slave. I do not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  accept responsibility for every other person on the planet nor do I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  accept any fault for the results of dictatorships thousands of miles</i><br>
<i>&gt;  away.</i><br>
Obligations are enforced by ones own conscience.  Moral imperatives must not<br>
be enforced by the state.  You are in no way compelled by any police power to<br>
help others, nor to accept fault for the sins of others.  However, our common<br>
humanity does place the obligation on us to help.  How we choose to obey or<br>
ignore that obligation does not change that obligation.  I hold that human<br>
society is the poorer when we turn our backs on the needy when we have<br>
sufficient.<br>
<p>
You can not hide behind a claim that you would be a slave, as long as the<br>
obligation is not forced on you.  You may decide some other action is better<br>
for your humanity than what the preachers (secular or spiritual) call for.<br>
You may not have enough to share.  You may decide that you don't care.  But<br>
you decide how to act.  That is where the sin of the welfare state lies:  do-<br>
gooders in Washington or Sacramento substitute their wishes through the<br>
legislative and police power of the state to force you to do what they think<br>
is a good idea.  The moral bankruptcy of the welfare state is self-evident,<br>
when you consider that it would not exist without the police power of<br>
taxation.  If it were truly the solution to the problems it proposed to solve,<br>
then the welfare state would be instituted by the voluntary charitable giving<br>
of those with more to those with less.<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  And what exactly are you proposing we should do to help these poor souls</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in third world hell holes? Should the U.S. attempt an invasion of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  entire continent of Africa? Are you going to sign up for this? Or are we</i><br>
<i>&gt;  just supposed to send more bags of food and money over with no assurance</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that it will ever get to those in need?</i><br>
Why do you think that a call to stop hellholes requires statist action?<br>
Members of the Lincoln Brigade did what they thought best in Spain in the 30s.<br>
If we would repeal the laws prohibiting private mercenaries and private<br>
foreign policy, then you would be free to fight the Idi Amins of the world, or<br>
ignore them as you see fit.  If you don't think private militaries are<br>
possible, go to the library and read up about Executive Outcomes, a private<br>
SOuth African group that advises other African States.<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Actually, I think the best thing to do would be to ship firearms over to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  any legitimate freedom fighters so they can take out the evil leaders</i><br>
<i>&gt;  responsible for keeping their countries in poverty. All financial and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  food aid should cease unless we know for sure that it isn't lining the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pockets of various corrupt government officials. (Tens of billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Western dollars have already gone down the toilet and we don't need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  waste more!)</i><br>
I trust you mean you would spend your money to buy firearms and ship them to<br>
freedom fighters, and not that the DOD or State Department would decide who<br>
are legitimate freedom fighters.  Trusting our government led to the quagmires<br>
of Bosnia, Vietnam, the Arab-Israeli imbroglio, and the 100 plus other nations<br>
where the US has imposed its military presence.  It's time to close the<br>
overseas military bases, and shut down the Empire.  American defense dollars<br>
for american defense.  We are not the policeman of the world, and should give<br>
up trying to do what is impossible.<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Actually, Africa has a long tradition of free markets and decentralized</i><br>
<i>&gt;  power. Recent events are a historical aberration.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
What Africa actually has is a history of ineffectual statecraft, so the lack<br>
of a state made the markets appear free.  In fact, Africa culture is tribal<br>
and strongly communal, so what westerners think of as a free market and<br>
decentralized is not an accurate description.<br>
