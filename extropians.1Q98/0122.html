A seemingly sober desire.<br>

<p>
I'm no expert, but I'm under the impression that many types of strokes<br>
are caused when blood vessels break inside the brain, depriving some<br>
areas of oxygen and nutrients.  I'm not sure of the relative frequencies<br>
of this type of damage...  Sounds like a job for Anders???:)<br>
<p>

<p>
It sounds neat, but the image that appears in my head is of someone<br>
so afraid of a stroke that she gets these release valves put in only to<br>
find all her favorite activities -- scuba diving, skiing, kick boxing, <br>
soccer, rough sex -- precluded.  Or of her getting into a car accident<br>
on a very hot day, bumping her head and bleeding to death before<br>
the paremedics can arrive.  I would not want to give up all those<br>
things that make life worth living, which I hope to continue into the<br>
far distant future on the off chance of a stroke.<br>
<p>
Now, those are just my horror images.  Before going further, one should<br>
examine how often this type of stroke is likely, what parts of the brain it<br>
happens at, what one's susceptibility rate is, and whether pressure relief<br>
is the solution.  It the type of stroke is highly unlikely or one is of very low<br>
susceptibility, then the cost might be too high -- the effort could be<br>
invested in other life extension measures or just in enjoying life.  Etc.<br>
<p>
Now, let's say this is a very serious matter, then we might look into<br>
designing such valves which can allow one to lead an active life-<br>
style, be esthetically appealing (i.e., invisible:), give off some kind of<br>
warning (wouldn't want to bleed to death because the release valve<br>
is so good at evacuating the brain case of excess fluids:), and be <br>
cheap.<br>
<p>
Just MHO.:)<br>
