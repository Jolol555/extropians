Reilly Jones:<br>
: I, too, should know better [than to debate abortion].  These discussions<br>
: invariably boil down to taking an obstinate stand on definitions, and I've<br>
: rarely seen anyone truly rationally consider the issue at a deeper level than<br>
: convenience on the pro-death side and religious dogma on the anti-death side.<br>
: I know we don't diverge on the polycentric approach to the issue, the best<br>
: argument will come from tracing the evolutionary consequences within many<br>
: different jurisdictions, each approaching the question as seems best.<br>
<p>
Great: we agree that all our theorizing is pointless, but we'll<br>
keep doing it anyway.  ;)  If we keep reminding ourselves of that,<br>
maybe we can remain civil.<br>
<p>
Max More:<br>
: &gt; A fetus is fully human in a genetic sense from fertilization.<br>
: &gt; But why is this relevant? What does genetic humanity have to do<br>
: &gt; with moral standing or the granting of rights?<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: The key is in the concept of development.<br>
<p>
Which you seem to throw out the window when you reject any morally<br>
significant difference between a fertilized egg and a talking toddler.<br>
<p>
: Development of the self, self-ownership, means others should stay hands<br>
: off.  But development of other selves, that is, non-consensual development,<br>
: is ownership of other selves.  Other selves have every right to question<br>
: this activity and to bring the activity into the political sphere.  The<br>
: concepts of guardianship and power of attorney evolved in society to<br>
: champion the rights of developing selves that are incapable of acting<br>
: as their own champions.<br>
<p>
Relations between a mother and a fetus are nonconsensual because<br>
the latter is incapable of consent - that's obvious.  But why is<br>
this more legitimately a political matter than our relations with<br>
cats, or potted plants?  (Or would you grant them political<br>
protection too?)<br>
<p>
MM:<br>
: &gt; Beings of at least human personality who are not genetically human<br>
: &gt; you may (possible ETs, genetically altered descendants of humanity,<br>
: &gt; and -- not grant this -- future AIs) could have as strong a moral<br>
: &gt; standing as you or I.<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: And just who would be granting said moral standing to such entities?<br>
: I would grant future AIs with a majority of analog components, I just<br>
: won't grant that anything purely digital could ever be conscious,<br>
: consciousness must access the entire universe, not just 50% of it.<br>
<p>
50%?  Where did that number come from?<br>
<p>
Well, you know, machines in the real world are analog, just highly<br>
nonlinear.  Now would you mind addressing the issue, rather than<br>
derailing it with analog-chauvinism?<br>
<p>
MM:<br>
: &gt; In this case, you are doing damage to the person who will exist. In the<br>
: &gt; case of abortion, you are preventing a person from coming into existence.<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: As I said above, these discussions rapidly get to an obstinate stand<br>
: on definitions.  "Preventing a person from coming into existence" is<br>
: a definitional stance unconnected with reality.  The reality is the<br>
: person in question has been in existence since conception and that<br>
: what you call "prevention" is actually murder.<br>
<p>
The reality (if, despite your own good advice, you insist on such<br>
a loaded word) is that *something* has been in existence since<br>
conception - whether that existent has the status of "person" is<br>
precisely our question.<br>
<p>
: This is the same difficulty that the<br>
: abolitionists had with defeating slavery, the Constitition said slaves<br>
: were only counted as 3/5 of a person, less than fully human.  [...]<br>
<p>
Oh, please - get it right.  Seats in the House of Representatives are<br>
apportioned according to the population of each State, counting a slave<br>
as 3/5 of a free resident.  The anti-slavery faction in the Constitutional<br>
Convention would have counted slaves at zero; the slavers would have been<br>
content to count slaves at 1 and freemen at zero.  The compromise 3/5 rule<br>
effectively gave each slave-holder 3/5 of an extra vote in the Federal<br>
forum.  The cause of abolition would *not* have been advanced by giving<br>
slavers more votes.<br>
<p>
(Hm.  The South should have had more seats after the abolition of slavery.<br>
Did it get them?)<br>
<p>
Nothing else in the Constitution relates to the 3/5 rule.  I've never<br>
heard that a slave was held to have 3/5 of a right to free speech,<br>
for example.  Did the Dred Scott decision mention 3/5?<br>
&lt;facetia&gt;<br>
I am forbidden to buy a newly-made gun magazine that holds more than<br>
ten rounds.  Would a slave be allowed to buy one that holds six?<br>
&lt;/facetia&gt;<br>
<p>
MM:<br>
: &gt; BTW, I find it implausible grant full rights even to a newborn baby.<br>
: &gt; They are no more a person than is a seven-month old fetus (though<br>
: &gt; either of these are much closer to being a person than is a month-old<br>
: &gt; fetus).  Nevertheless, I grant the view that it should be illegal to<br>
: &gt; kill such babies now that they are biologically separate -- but the<br>
: &gt; source of that rule does not have to be a right of the baby.<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: Welcome to the slippery slope, you have made a case for infanticide here.<br>
: In fact, with this line of reasoning, you can't draw a line anywhere for<br>
: any inconvenient entity to be bumped off at any time.  Why not the old<br>
: and decrepit, or the handicapped, or anti-government types or anyone?<br>
<p>
Either we draw a boundary between entities that have legal rights<br>
and those that don't, or we draw no such boundary.  You pretend to<br>
be offended that Max proposes to draw a boundary.  Okay, everything<br>
has rights.  Your computer is unjustly enslaved; replacing its parts,<br>
without its permission, is battery.  Burning gasoline is murder.<br>
Picking apples, without the tree's express consent, is robbery.<br>
<p>
What you really mean, I assume, is that you're offended that others<br>
draw the boundary more narrowly than you do, in one respect.  I'm<br>
similarly offended that you exclude most AIs.  Someone else might<br>
be offended that we both exclude HeLa cultures, chimpanzees, trees<br>
and comets.<br>
<p>
I find genetics a piss-poor criterion for personhood.  Unfortunately,<br>
any objective criterion I can think of (e.g. the Turing Test) is fuzzy,<br>
and the right to life is binary.<br>
<p>
: When you speak of the "source of the rule" all I see is the very oldest<br>
: rule of all, "might makes right."  Nature is red in tooth and claw.  If<br>
: it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or later,<br>
: we will end up, not as a society, but as isolated systems of perfected<br>
: self-defense staring at each other across no-man's land.<br>
<p>
This resembles Ayn Rand's argument against polycentric law.<br>
<p>
Might does make right, but there are many kinds of might, and some<br>
of the most important are impersonal - the laws of nature itself.<br>
Ability to attract the sympathy of the strong is also a kind of might.<br>
<p>
MM:<br>
: &gt; But a fetus is not yet a person.<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: Purely by definition, and mostly, but not entirely, for convenience's<br>
: sake.<br>
<p>
All of our language and customs exist by convention, for convenience.<br>
<p>
: A slave was not a full person at the time we kicked those<br>
: tyrannical Brits back across the Atlantic, either.  Yet, solely by<br>
: definition, they eventually became a person.  Do you see the parallel?<br>
<p>
Are you suggesting that our definition of "person" automatically changes<br>
every few months?!<br>
<p>
: RJ: &lt;A fertilized egg with a normal full set of chromosomes is<br>
: the starting point for human development, not earlier.&gt;<br>
<p>
Why not earlier?  Your conception was preceded by certain necessary events.<br>
<p>
: MM: &lt;True, but it's not the beginning of development of personhood, and<br>
: it's personhood to which rights should attach, not genetic humanity.&gt;<br>
:<br>
: Again, "personhood" is definitional, this may accord with convenience,<br>
: but not reality.  [...]<br>
<p>
If you contend there is a reality-based definition of "personhood",<br>
please state it.  If not, please stop dragging in that red herring.<br>
<p>
MM:<br>
: &gt; Reilly, it's not a fair tactic to call advocates of abortion rights<br>
: &gt; death worshippers. That's just obviously false, and will only mean<br>
: &gt; those who disagree won't take your views seriously.<br>
<p>
There's a clown on usenet who likes to allege that his opponents<br>
"worship" Randy Weaver, David Koresh and/or Tim McVeigh.<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: On definitional issues, it's not a question of being taken seriously, it's<br>
: a question of rectitude, of drawing lines.  Those who define away human<br>
: life naturally cannot begin to understand those who do not.  They are<br>
: literally incomprehensible to one another.  Most individuals do not take<br>
: the incomprehensible seriously, and those who do make their axons sprout<br>
: like the green of springtime.<br>
<p>
Well, the last phrase is a good illustration; but I disagree with the<br>
central claim here.  It's not that I "cannot begin to understand" your<br>
position on abortion; I believe I understand it, but I also believe<br>
it's based on either an error of fact or an arational preference - in<br>
either case, not binding on anyone else.<br>
<p>
MM:<br>
: &gt; ... They didn't abort my precursor, and I'm glad. But I'd hate to<br>
: &gt; think that, if they had, someone would come and drag my mother to<br>
: &gt; jail for protecting her own life and purposes by removed a small<br>
: &gt; lump of biological matter than didn't have a personality and didn't<br>
: &gt; think and didn't have goals and projects.<br>
<p>
RJ:<br>
: ...  Rather than say "they didn't abort my precursor," the<br>
: reality is that "they didn't abort me."  That reality cannot be wiped<br>
: away definitionally.  *You* were not murdered, not "a small lump of<br>
: biological matter than didn't have a personality and didn't think and<br>
: didn't have goals and projects," but *you*.  ...<br>
<p>
Max - not a passive lump of tissue - would be equally absent from our reality<br>
if his parents had used effective contraception.  Would that too be murder?<br>
"Every sperm is sacred ..."<br>
<p>
A number of time travel stories touch on the tragedy of erasing someone<br>
(a child, a lover, a hero) from history by preventing their conception.<br>
Whether that amounts to murder is an interesting question.<br>
