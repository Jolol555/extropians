No, not for certain, but there is cause for alarm and I believe the<br>
consequences such bannings are not to be taken lightly.  Much of my<br>
concern stems from recent public attacks gene engineering and clonning.  I<br>
know people have reacted negativley in the past to tech that eventually<br>
was accepted and proved very useful.  However, I think that in most<br>
poeple's minds, the notion of quelling pain with anesthetics is not as<br>
"unnatural" as more permanent tamperings like clonning, genetic<br>
engineering, or implants that make you smarter than the avergage<br>
constituent.  Especially when politicians adopt such issues just for<br>
fun/polical gain and feed the paranioa.  <br>
<p>
I suspect that the outcome of the current cloning and gene engineering<br>
debates will set a presedent for future "ethicly troubling" technologies,<br>
both from  entrepeneurial and legislative stand points (Who wants to<br>
develop technology likely to be banned?  Who wants to develop technology<br>
for just a small band of futurists somewhere in the middle of the ocean?<br>
We've banned similar technologies, we might as well ban these as well)<br>
If these current rages pass without criminalization then I will be much<br>
more optimistic about future developments gaining acceptance.  I agree<br>
that much of the reasoning for keeping drugs illegal is b/c they were<br>
illegal and I expect that attitudes will be no less yeilding to clonning,<br>
genetic enginneering etc. once, if,  they are banned.  I suspect we will<br>
have a good idea of how willing the legislative bodies of the world are to<br>
accept enhancing technologies before the Extropia Sovereinty Fund is rich<br>
enough to build/buy political refuge.  It might not be a bad idea to start<br>
saving now, just in case.<br>
<p>
My general outlook on the question whether transhumanist ideals will gain<br>
enough acceptance to grow more or less unhindered (except where prohibited<br>
by physical law) is a cost benefit analysis. Which is more trouble:<br>
Establishing a physical space of refuge, terrestrial or otherwise, or<br>
fighting/subverting political barriers.  Tough call.<br>
