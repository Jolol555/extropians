I'd like to begin some discussion re- life enhancing/extending<br>
notions I use which are not very exotic to me but likely not used by <br>
many..<br>
<p>
I have always been a health info. hound and over the years have found<br>
a few good items.<br>
<p>
2 years ago when my wife began to suffer from multiple sclerosis<br>
I renewed my search for items my doctor would approve of but which<br>
our medicare and medical system in Canada would not allow Rx for...<br>
capitated/rationed/muzzeled/cost-benefit contained medicine.<br>
<p>
Anyway before You all go to sleep/delete this item here's the<br>
good stuff.<br>
<p>
I have been using the immune modulant levamisole since 1976.<br>
1976-1995 quite irregularly 185 mg per dose usually once per month.<br>
1995-97 once per week.  1997 till today 150 mg every saturday and <br>
sunday.  <br>
<p>
I buy the compound in a form identical to the human Rx as a powder<br>
used worldwide to worm all kinds of livestock and also children<br>
in 3rd world countries.  The Rx form from your physician is 75-120 X<br>
as costly so I will continue this access method as gross as it may <br>
sound.<br>
<p>
What does Levamisole do?  It finds utility in human medicine as<br>
a treatment which enhances destruction of metasteses in melanoma.<br>
NIH currently is funding a study to confirm it can be used as a life-<br>
long chemopreventative agent. <br>
<p>
This is a medication which has been in common usage for 30 years<br>
which may in another 20 become as common as vitamin C.<br>
<p>
Bye for now ....megao@sk.sympatico.ca<br>
