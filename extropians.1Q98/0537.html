Human cloning bans gather steam in U.S. states<br>
<p>
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A plan to clone humans has boosted moves<br>
in several states to outlaw the procedure, including in<br>
Illinois, home of the scientist who made the proposal earlier<br>
this week.<br>
<p>
A spokesman for Robert Churchill, a Republican state<br>
representative from Antioch, Illinois, said Friday proposed<br>
legislation to make human cloning a felony was gaining support<br>
and Churchill would seek to make it a priority when the state's<br>
General Assembly meets later this year.<br>
<p>
If the proposal became law convicted violators could face six<br>
years in prison.<br>
<p>
Similar efforts or proposals have surfaced in Ohio, Wisconsin and<br>
Connecticut. In addition President Clinton has called for a<br>
five-year federal moratorium on human cloning and Congress may<br>
also take up the issue.<br>
<p>
Richard Seed, a physicist who lives in the Chicago area, stirred<br>
up renewed debate on the question this week by saying he was<br>
ready to clone a human and could do so within 18 months if he<br>
raised enough money.<br>
<p>
Seed has said that he would move his operation to Mexico or<br>
the Caribbean if anti-cloning laws are passed.<br>

But it's looking like another miis-placed rendevous<br>
what are the Luddite left ? and what can it do to help<br>
Dr. Seed in any way ?<br>
<p>
Perhaps if one wanted to advance cloning technologies in the US<br>
one could start with some other animal like primates ...<br>
