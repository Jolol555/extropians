Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;Consensus--even unanymity--is not a scientific basis.  But in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;absense of real evidence, it's a moderately good substitute.</i><br>
<p>
Do I really need to cite the over 67 Medline studies that show <br>
substantive harm or effects of treatment?  Medline doesn't even <br>
include psychological studies, which number in the hundreds.  I'm <br>
really surprised to find such statements on a list that so actively <br>
supports the sciences. <br>
<p>
Opponents of such diagnoses as Gender Identity Syndrome and<br>
intersexual syndromes have been developing strong cases based on<br>
medical evidence, and they are gaining the support of influential<br>
researchers--where is the same for pedophilia?  If one of you would<br>
bother to spend five minutes in a database such as ERIC, MedLine,<br>
WorldCat, NIH, or FirstInfo and dig up something substantial, I'll<br>
listen.  Otherwise I just don't see the point in continuing this<br>
based on claims of a lack of evidence in the medical community or an <br>
opinion that psychology itself is bogus.<br>
