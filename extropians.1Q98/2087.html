Apropos the question that came up about the credibility of New<br>
Scientist, I have begun to worry about Scientific American. I have<br>
read it for as long as I have been able to read texts in english<br>
(actually longer, I learnt some of my english from trying to read my<br>
father's copies as a child), but recently I have begun to feel there<br>
is a downward trend in quality. The new, glossier format with larger<br>
and more colorful pictures is just one sign. Then there were the<br>
infamous article about nanotechnology, and now history seems to be<br>
repeating. Apparently the pro and con articles on the merits of animal<br>
use in biomedical research were judged on different criteria (in favor<br>
of the con side), allowing some unsubstantiated claims with no<br>
opportunity for the opponents to respond. See<br>
<a href="http://biomednet.com/hmsbeagle/member/1998/25/people/op_ed.htm">http://biomednet.com/hmsbeagle/member/1998/25/people/op_ed.htm</a> for<br>
their response, published in HMS Beagle.<br>
<p>
Are there any others who are disturbed by the trend in Scientific<br>
American? Are we loosing one of the in the past best popular<br>
scientific journals to a mere journal of opinion?<br>
