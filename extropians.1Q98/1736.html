<i>&gt; Increasing those other features you mentioned may tend to cause an increase</i><br>

<i>&gt; nor a good indicator of the others.</i><br>
<p>
As I mentioned before, there would seem to be a tradeoff between<br>
decisiveness and openness that I would want to take into consideration<br>
drawing the line as to just how complex I want my ethical deliberations to<br>
be.  Nevertheless I have a strong prejudice in favor of complexity.  We're<br>
probably talking a little past one another here.  To me, "simplicity" <br>
taken as a value in a moral system codes usually as intolerance and lack<br>
of imagination.  Want I want from ethical life are strategies that will<br>
put me in a position to appreciate and thrive in as many situations as<br>
either chance or my own design can contrive to throw at me.  What seems to<br>
me to be wanted from ethics is richness more than simplicity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  This is particularly true of moral systems. A moral system, if it is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be more than a personal set of habits, must be something that a community</i><br>
<i>&gt; can agree to follow. Simplicity is valuable in a moral system because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the easier it is to follow a moral system, the easier it is to keep it</i><br>
<i>&gt; effective by drawing a clear dividing line between those who follow it</i><br>
<i>&gt; and those who reject it. Also, the more rules a system has, the harder it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is to achieve a consensus about it.</i><br>
<p>
I would distinguish an individual moral code (an esthetic/prudential style<br>
of living and individual meaning-making), from a social or political civil<br>
code.  I think I've mentioned before that although I pretty strongly<br>
advocate vegetarian practices as individually broadening, I don't think<br>
vegetarian sensitivities should be mandated at the level of law.  This is<br>
partly for the reasons you mentioned above.  Still, even on your own terms<br>
it seems to me that simplicity isn't a *self-evident* value here.  Doesn't<br>
it sometimes conduce to the benefit of social stability for a moral code<br>
to institute wiggle-room and ongoing contestation of norms?  Sometimes<br>
it's good to make moral consensus a difficult thing to achieve.  Sometimes<br>
its good to keep the dividing lines between the moral and immoral pretty<br>
muddy (as when a clear "us" and "them" underwrites genocidal rages for<br>
order and purity).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Vegetarianism, unless accompanied by a clear principle for dividing</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonhuman lifeforms into those whose rights we respect and those we don't,</i><br>
<i>&gt; risks blurring the boundaries in a way that makes it seem easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; for people to decide that that boundary is just a matter of personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; choice.</i><br>
<p>
Animal rights discourse seems intriguing to me, but pretty flawed.  As a<br>
rule I simply try not to inflict pain knowingly and unecessarily on beings<br>
capable of experiencing it.  It does seem to me profoundly disrespectful<br>
to recognize that the pain experienced by the beings we instrumentalize as<br>
food (etc) is real but simply doesn't *matter*.  I want to respect as wide<br>
a range of beings as I can.  <br>
	One of the negative consequences of the line between human and<br>
nonhuman animals being so obvious to most people is that it creates a<br>
general category of beings whose pain doesn't matter to us ethically, a<br>
category that seems to attach pretty promiscuously to other beings whose<br>
pain we would prefer not to bother too much with.  It is a matter of<br>
record that justifications for misogynist or racist practices often<br>
(almost *always*) make recourse to the theme of the so-called subhuman or<br>
bestial nature of the people it dismisses.  Muddying these categorical<br>
waters and so depriving this rhetorical tactic of its sting would possibly<br>
be a salutary thing.<br>
	If I were in a position to argue with a Power who was on the verge<br>
of using the population of Poughkeepsie as ubergoo feedstock for some<br>
transhuman construction project, I would say that respecting diversity has<br>
the consequence of opening up an unforseeably richer range of pleasurable<br>
experiences (I for one don't think of my vegetarianism as a limiting or<br>
ascetic lifestyle as many seem to), as well as providing a robust and<br>
resilient cultural system better able to fend off dangers unforseeable to<br>
even such a Power.  I see my vegetarianism as a dress rehearsal for Power<br>
ethics to come.  (I'm sorry to hereby inflict the list with more "My<br>
Little Pony" extropianism.)  Anyway, I agree with you that the boundary<br>
does indeed seem to be one of personal choice.  I wouldn't say it is<br>
"just"  personal choice, since this suggests that stronger injunctions are<br>
available, when ultimately I suspect they are not.  Peter, thanks for the<br>
very considered reply to that last post.  We seem to be interested in<br>
similar problems even if we draw lines in different places.<br>
	Very interesting, very enjoyable.  Best, Dale<br>
