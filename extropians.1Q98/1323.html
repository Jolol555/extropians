While I have never to my knowledge seen hemp growing wild alongside <br>
the road, I have seen a great many other things growing there.<br>
<p>
Things growing in the ditch tend to grow close together, which in the <br>
case of cannabis plants makes them grow tall and gangly.  A lot of <br>
stem, not much leaf.<br>
<p>
Those who know even a little about cannabis cultivation, read that <br>
as "a lot of fiber for paper or cloth, but not much pot and <br>
that of low quality". <br>
<p>
In addition to which, being alongside the road it tends to pick up <br>
all sorts of interesting chemicals from traffic going by.<br>
