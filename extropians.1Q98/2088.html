I am no fan of immigration quotas, because I'm a big believer in the free<br>
market.  However, the so-called "high-tech labor shortage" is more horseshit<br>
than reality.  The basic fact is, most high-tech managers can't accept the<br>
fact that their "underlings" are actually worth more than they are, and<br>
therefore are unwilling to pay them what they're worth.  That's the<br>
foundation of this "labor shortage".  These clowns (managers) are just<br>
looking for cheap labor, so they can pay them less than they're worth, and<br>
they're worth a lot more than them.<br>
<p>
This is one of the shining examples of why management is looked down upon.<br>

<i>&gt;  It's so typical for this so-called planning system to start</i><br>
<i>&gt;handling the situation after it has developed into a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious crisis, that I don't even find it funny anymore...</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, this may be very symptomatic - I suggested this very</i><br>
<i>&gt;scenario to my friend yesterday, with the hope that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;quickening progress of technology will destroy justifications</i><br>
<i>&gt;for at least some restrictions on personal liberty.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe, this is a first step on making highly skilled labor</i><br>
<i>&gt;a globally privileged elite, as the recognition of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;importance, scarcity and exterritorial nature of their work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Nature doesn't apply the same territorial restrictions to</i><br>
<i>&gt;tigers and fungi; the governments, so far, have)</i><br>

<i>&gt; High-tech Firms Seek To End Cap On Foreign Workers</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; By Deeann Glamser</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft and other high-tech companies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which say they face a critical shortage of programmers and</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers, this week will ask Congress to eliminate the hiring</i><br>
<i>&gt; cap on foreign professionals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "This has slowly built to a crisis situation this year," Brian</i><br>
<i>&gt; Raymond, domestic policy manager for the American Electronics</i><br>
<i>&gt; Association, a trade group representing some 3,000 technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies, said in a recent interview.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; At issue are H-1B visas, allowing non-citizen doctors, computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmers and other professionals to work in the United States</i><br>
<i>&gt; for up to six years. The visas are used to fill shortages of</i><br>
<i>&gt; skilled workers, or are for people with extraordinary talents.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This year, the annual limit of 65,000 H-1B visas is expected to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be hit by June, with no more issued until Oct. 1, the start of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the next federal fiscal year.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Last year, the allotment was gone by September, the first time</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limit was reached.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Senate Judiciary Committee has a hearing scheduled for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wednesday on H-1B visas for high-tech workers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft, Texas Instruments Inc. and Sun Microsystems officials</i><br>
<i>&gt; will testify in favor of repealing the cap.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; leading U.S. professional group for electrical and electronics</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineers, wants to retain the current limit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Visa information is sketchy, but 44 percent of pre- application</i><br>
<i>&gt; certifications -- the requests companies make to the Labor</i><br>
<i>&gt; Department as a prerequisite for applying for an H-1B visa -- in</i><br>
<i>&gt; fiscal 1997 were for computer occupations, up from 25 percent in</i><br>
<i>&gt; fiscal 1995.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The next-largest category in fiscal 1997 was physical therapists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; at 26 percent of requests.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Information Technology Association of America, a trade</i><br>
<i>&gt; association that also opposes the cap, says companies with 100 or</i><br>
<i>&gt; more employees have 346,000 openings for programmers, systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; analysts and computer engineers, or 10 percent of the nation's</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3.3 million information-technology jobs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments hires about 150 H-1B visa</i><br>
<i>&gt; holders a year, 10 percent to 15 percent of its annual technical</i><br>
<i>&gt; hires.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most are graduate students at U.S. universities and become</i><br>
<i>&gt; residents here. The majority are from Taiwan and India.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "These employees are critical. We depend greatly on electrical</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineering talent to build our products," said Stephen Leven,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Texas Instruments director of worldwide human resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Intel also wants the cap repealed. It hires 300 to 400 foreign</i><br>
<i>&gt; design engineers a year, almost a third of the design engineers</i><br>
<i>&gt; it hires annually and about 4 percent of the slightly more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; 10,000 people it hired in 1997.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As at Texas Instruments, most are graduate students sponsored by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the company for residency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Visa-limit proponents say more U.S. students are enrolling in</i><br>
<i>&gt; engineering and computer sciences as job prospects surge, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; older employees can be retrained for the changing job market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "We really believe there is a sufficient amount of people to</i><br>
<i>&gt; satisfy needs in the U.S.," said Paul Kostek, a Seattle- based</i><br>
<i>&gt; consultant and president-elect of the Institute of Electrical and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Electronics Engineers-USA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Norman Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of</i><br>
<i>&gt; California at Davis, said companies exacerbate the worker</i><br>
<i>&gt; shortage by requiring very specific skills for each job and</i><br>
<i>&gt; preferring males in their 20s and 30s.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "They want them young, and with the latest, hot technology, "</i><br>
<i>&gt; Matloff said. "For experienced programmers, learning a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; language is no big deal."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; He said visa workers earn less on average than their U.S. peers</i><br>
<i>&gt; and are unlikely to leave a company sponsoring them for permanent</i><br>
<i>&gt; residency.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft has not released its H-1B figures, but says a mix of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cultural backgrounds is critical in a global marketplace.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "It's important for us to hire the most appropriate workers to</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; compete," said Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan.</i><br>
