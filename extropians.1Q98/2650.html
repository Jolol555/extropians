<i>&gt; From: Yak Wax &lt;yakwax@yahoo.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A few people on this list, myself included, have commented on taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal research underground and possibly attempting to control</i><br>
<i>&gt; political movements that may counter progress.  And while it may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; futile to even try this, it has a certain undeniable appeal.  Besides,</i><br>
<i>&gt; why do we all seem so intent on obeying the law?  Nobody's holding a</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun to your head!</i><br>
<p>
It has probably something to do with waxing fat under the current regime<br>
and such. People with good jobs (and especially scientists) make lousy <br>
revolutionaries.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; So, how about some people share their wisdom as to why it wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; work, what such an organisation should do if it could work, and how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; go about implementing it.  I have some ideas of my own, but for now</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm going to keep them shadowy and elusive...</i><br>
<p>
In theory transhumanists could make a great underground organization;<br>
hardly any group packs more raw mental power than this one. Fortunately<br>
for the powers that be organizing and getting revolutionary aren't exactly<br>
our strongest points, maybe by definition. Still, I like the idea of a "shadow <br>
ExI". Not only is this simply fun and a way to gain some extra material wealth, <br>
but ultimately it might be the only way to survive the future. Unfortunately this <br>
idea is about as viable as an aborted fetus...<br>
