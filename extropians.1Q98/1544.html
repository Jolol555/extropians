  I agree and practice, actually - don't take my posts too seriously,<br>
I play with words for arguments' sake and fun.  My last lover, a month<br>
ago, was a young passionate Israeli woman who likes spending time<br>
discussing philosophy with Bedouins, and who was telling me that in U.S.,<br>
people know how to make money but don't know how to live.  Before her,<br>
an oriental woman who went from Transcendental Meditation to software<br>
development; she was a good dancer - a rare thing at the time where<br>
people can't do much more than hope around and flail their limbs.<br>
She liked expressing here ideas that "science doesn't explain much",<br>
and I couldn't stand that for long.   There is a big difference <br>
between a lover and a girlFriend though; a real relationship requires<br>
good mutual understanding and commonality of interests.<br>
Otherwise, I love hanging out with all kinds of people, and have<br>
good friends between 15 and 75 years of age, with all kinds of beliefs<br>
and interests, and learn a lot from any of them; it's quite interesting<br>
to practice changing your roles in relationships, too.<br>
