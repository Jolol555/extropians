If anyone has pointed this out, I've missed it.  Area to support plants<br>
is not the only limitation; sunlight, or energy, is equally important.<br>
The Earth intercepts only so much sunlight.  A skyscraper won't change<br>
that.  It casts an area in shadow, and piles up an equivalent area.  The<br>
benefit is that you get climate control; the drawback is that you have<br>
to build the building.  That's it.  Agri-Manhattan can't grow much more<br>
than it could as a conventional farm.  What would the extra plants grow<br>
on?<br>
<p>
Unless you import energy for artificial light, of course.  Not a big<br>
concern right now.<br>
<p>
And, a la the power companies preferring to make consumers more<br>
efficient than to build a new power plant, it might be better to raise<br>
up and educate the masses of the Third World than to worry about how to<br>
increase our population.<br>
