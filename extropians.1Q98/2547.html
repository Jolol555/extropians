<i>&gt; From: Mark D. Fulwiler &lt;mfulwiler@earthlink.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; Actually, I think the best thing to do would be to ship firearms over to</i><br>
<i>&gt; any legitimate freedom fighters so they can take out the evil leaders</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for keeping their countries in poverty. </i><br>
<p>
Not a good idea; the freedom fighters of today are the "evil leaders" <br>
of tomorrow. All you'd do is waste more billions to finance the next<br>
crisis. Do we really need to create more Saddams?<br>
<p>
Actually, the only thing that might help is to reintroduce strict colonial<br>
rule, although it might be too late for that now. In any case it would<br>
be monstrously expensive, bad PR and would almost certainly backfire.<br>
Since nothing really seems to work then what's there left to do (assuming<br>
that you find this a high-priority issue, which from a purely rational point of<br>
view it isn't)? Probably the best course of action would be redirecting the<br>
bulk of foreign aid towards scientific projects, especially nanotech-related<br>
ones. A replicator in every home should pretty much do the trick. Um,<br>
unless the governments don't like it, of course.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All financial and</i><br>
<i>&gt; food aid should cease unless we know for sure that it isn't lining the</i><br>
<i>&gt; pockets of various corrupt government officials. (Tens of billions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Western dollars have already gone down the toilet and we don't need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; waste more!)</i><br>
<p>
Don't hold your breath!<br>
