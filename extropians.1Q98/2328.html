Ian Goddard wrote 3/2/98: &lt;I think the answer points to individual<br>
consciousness being a product not so much of one subatomic particle more<br>
than others, but of a holistic concert of multiple entities, such that the<br>
individual self is not in any one of the many entities of which it is<br>
composed, but is only in them all.  Being a radical holist, I see this<br>
holistic principle extending even beyond the confines of the finite self to<br>
encompass and contain the entire universe in the definition of "self," and<br>
I believe that I prove this is a valid definition due to the fact that all<br>
attributes of your identity and of my identity are derived from a holistic<br>
relation that contains the whole.&gt;<br>
<p>
I agree with you that the self, through consciousness, freely roams the<br>
universe.  Consciousness may be a point aspect of the backwards-in-time<br>
microcausality from Cramer's transactional QM interpretation.  However,<br>
there still is a subjective "I" separate from everything else in the<br>
universe.  This separation is what makes it impossible for anyone to ever<br>
produce a valid scientific theory of consciousness, each individual<br>
consciousness is utterly unique and totally inaccessible.  You, Ian, cannot<br>
ever feel what I feel inside, nor can any experiment test any theory about<br>
what I feel, subjectivity is impenetrable.  There is a boundary between "I"<br>
and the rest of the universe, and this boundary is definite, not<br>
indefinite.  There really is something that gives coherency to the<br>
subjective "I" and that something constructs a boundary between one quark<br>
or bit of substance and the quark immediately next to it.<br>
