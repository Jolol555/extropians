<i>&gt; If better technology caused faster economic growth, optimism about new</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The following analysis suggests, however, that if growth rates are limited</i><br>

<i>&gt; insensitive to technology, and hence long remain near historical levels.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The basic argument is this: Interest rates are determined by the supply</i><br>
<i>&gt; and demand for investment resources.  The supply curve seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; basically flat at historical rates of 1-3%, and for good evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons.  The demand curve rises with technology, but since there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; effectively no property rights in investment projects, all the demand</i><br>
<i>&gt; curve above the level where supply and demand meet is burned up in a race</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be first.  So ROI should remain near historical rates until some new</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology is so good that, even with most world income being saved</i><br>
<i>&gt; and invested in related projects, the expected ROI for even the least</i><br>
<i>&gt; attractive projects becomes much higher than historical interest rates.</i><br>

  Robin, I'm not sure I follow your argument. The "explosive growth" argument<br>
is that certain technological improvements will increase the productivity of<br>
technologists. even if the real investment rate in innovation is flat, the<br>
rate of  technological improvement will increase because of the productivity<br>
improvement. If technology increases the productivity of technological<br>
innovators relative to other workers (unsupported assumption), then the ROI<br>
for technical innovation will rise relative to other investments. This effect<br>
would push innovation even faster, even with a flat perentage investment.<br>
