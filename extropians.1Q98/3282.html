<p>
I know this from some five years experience (moderate and light use)<br>
with the drug. The effects have been confirmed by most other users I talked <br>
to, and by general cannabis literature (not the government stuff, of course).<br>
Of course these experiences are very subjective, but even if you only *think*<br>
that they are meaningful, then they are in fact meaningful. Like the text below<br>
says, (see link) there really hasn't been much research yet into the finer<br>
effects on creativity and such. Most testing is still heavily influenced by the<br>
negative "hippyboy" image of weed, and doesn't come much further than<br>
concluding that "mice get slow when really stoned" - or something like that.<br>
<p>
What is pretty clear though is that moderate use, especially if you vaporize<br>
the stuff is extremely safe, and that at least the subjective feel of the<br>
experience can be profound. My appreciation of music has greatly increased<br>
since I smoke pot, for example. You really learn how to focus on different<br>
aspects of it, smoothly amplifying or blocking notes and rhytms, creating<br>
new songs as you go along. Try it!<br>
<p>
A good place to look is:<br>

<p>
Point by point:<br>
<p>
Fun -- This is something most people can agree on ;-) I have found that the<br>
more depressed you are before use, the happier you will get after. There is<br>
no dip as you "return to normal"; you stay in a good mood (effects may<br>
vary from person to person, and from situation to situation but ik works<br>
for me).<br>
<p>
Aphrodisiac -- THC increases the heart rate and general blood flow, <br>
while at the same time inhibitations melt away and the imagination works<br>
overtime. These are the clinical facts, the real thing is MUCH better<br>
(try for yourself).<br>
 <br>
Better sensory processing -- all senses are intensified, and it's a lot easier to<br>
focus on any one of them. Food for example becomes a whole new<br>
experience.<br>
<p>
Critical thinking -- when high you see all kinds of interesting things about<br>
events and people that you didn't notice before, new insights often just pop<br>
into your head.<br>
<p>
I know many people on this list are prejudiced when it comes to drugs<br>
like marijuana, but they should really try it for themselves first (a couple<br>
of times, it usually doesn't work properly the first time) and then make an<br>
*informed* judgement. You don't have to explain why MJ is <br>
transhumanistically relevant to anyone who has actually tried it ;-)<br>

<i>&gt; &gt;Use DHEA and/or carnitine for fat control, muscle buildup without training</i><br>
<i>&gt; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;increased fitness (among other things).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm very interesting in these, but I'm not really sure where I'd learn more</i><br>
<i>&gt; about them.  Any tips?</i><br>
<p>
Try <a href="http://www.ceri.com/dhea.htm">http://www.ceri.com/dhea.htm</a> for DHEA info and <br>
<a href="http://lef.org/prod_hp/php-ab041.html">http://lef.org/prod_hp/php-ab041.html</a> and http://lef.org/shop/alc1.htm<br>
for carnitine info. The Life Extension Foundation also has lots of other<br>
great drug info ( <a href="http://www.lef.org">http://www.lef.org</a> ).<br>
<p>
Also in this case I have first hand info, which may or may not apply to<br>
others (only one way to find out). I've been using carnitine for approx.<br>
half a year, with the following results (within a month): 1) decrease of<br>
access fat, especially around the waist. 2) hardening and moderate<br>
growth of muscles (without any noteworthy training). 3) couple of<br>
kilos weight gain due to muscle growth 4) more energy &amp; better<br>
general fitness 5) a generally more assertive feel (but this is hard to<br>
measure objectively, though not surprising since testosterone levels<br>
are increased by carnitine intake).<br>
<p>
I use: Carnitene TM, from Sigma Tau (R) - Italy <br>
The "official" indications are:<br>
<p>
--fast deterioration of muscle function<br>
--problems with the central nervous system<br>
--the build-up of fat in muscle tissues or other tissues<br>
<p>
DHEA has pretty much similar effects, as far as I can tell (after a<br>
couple of weeks of use). Personally I prefer carnitine though, it's<br>
effects are pleasantly milder (very subjective, of course). Afaik both<br>
supplements increase testosterone levels, among other things.<br>
<p>
As an alternative to directly taking DHEA you might try ADHS, a<br>
substance that stimulates the natural production of DHEA (in the<br>
thyroid gland, I think). I have mine from Biotics Research Corporation, <br>
Houston, Texas 77236<br>
