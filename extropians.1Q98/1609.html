In response to Mark Unicorn and Yak Wax:<br>
<p>
Although I recognize the libertarian yearnings behind your postings,<br>
most of your comments are completely unfounded in clinical<br>
psychology or biology.  Emotional readiness is just as important a<br>
factor in sexuality as physical readiness, and fetishes (not a<br>
sickness, BTW) and rape inclinations do not stem from sexual<br>
deprivation.  Therapists treat thousands of individuals yearly in my<br>
country alone for the damage caused by pedophiliac activities or<br>
pressure to have sex at a young age.  Given the difficulty in<br>
repairing that kind of damage, I'd rather have a young person<br>
chomping at the bit a little prior to engaging in any serious sexual<br>
activities.  Most of them have engaged in heavy petting by high<br>
school, anyway, and haven't exactly been deprived of pleasure. <br>
Learning to pleasure oneself is important as well, an important<br>
first step in learning to pleasure others.  <br>
<p>
Practice makes perfect!<br>
