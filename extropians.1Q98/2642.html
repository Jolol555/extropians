Grrr.  On rec.arts.sf.science people show their math.  "Astrological"<br>
calculations based on Newton's law below.<br>
<p>
F=G*M*m/R^2.  G and m (your mass) are constant, so I'll look at M/R^2.<br>
<p>
M moon[1]: 7e22 kg.  R (semimajor axis): 384,000 km == 3.8e8 m.<br>
<p>
M/R^2= 4.8e5.<br>
<p>
M person: 100 kg.  R: 1 meter.<br>
M/R^2= 100.<br>
<p>
Ouch.  But you know, people do get closer than one meter.<br>
<p>
R= 1cm.  M/R^2= 1e6.<br>
<p>
So your sex partner, or mother, seem to be twice as significant as the moon.<br>
Never mind riding a crowded train.  Actually, since their mass and yours are<br>
spread out over several centimeters (along a line going through two mashed<br>
torsos) we'd actually have differential effects in the bodies, as the force<br>
fades rapidly.<br>
<p>
So Dawkins wasn't far off.  And any other planet is even less significant.<br>
Jupiter M is 1.9e27 kg, R=7.8e11m.  R/M^2= 3122.<br>
Venus M= 4.8e24 kg, R=1e11 m, R/M^2= 480<br>
<p>
and everything else will be smaller than the biggest and closest planets.<br>
<p>
One cubic kilometer of rock masses 3 trillion kilogram, so the number for a<br>
mountain three kilometers away would be 1e5, and my horoscope should be<br>
affected by whether I was born (how about live?) in Chicago or Pasadena.<br>
<p>
And if we throw G (6e-11) back into the equation, we can see just how big <br>
these forces actually are.<br>
