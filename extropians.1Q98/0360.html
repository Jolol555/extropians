<p>
Education *always* instills values, *always* is a kind of indoctrination. <br>
There is no such thing as "knowledge and skills" without valuation<br>
attached.  Determining which among the indefinitely many skills and<br>
knowledges on offer will be the ones taught, let alone determining what<br>
will *count* as "useful" in the first place will inevitably be practices<br>
that resonate with beliefs about what society should look like and how<br>
people should behave in it.  Given this, the values that I would emphasise<br>
in an properly extropian pedagogy would be responsibility, criticism, and<br>
respect for diversity.  Best, Dale<br>
