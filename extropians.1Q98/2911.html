That's right, that was it.<br>

<p>
I don't think it's meant to be a serious statement (that is, neither i nor<br>
anyone else beleives that what the US is trying to do is send a secret<br>
message), just a fun and concise way of showing the large number of<br>
countries that the US invaded/s, and trying to back up Eduardo's point.<br>
