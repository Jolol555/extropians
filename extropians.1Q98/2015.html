I understand the romantic appeal of Extropians having their own physical<br>
country, but I don't understand why Extropians would want to limit<br>
themselves to a small land area.  Aren't we *beyond* thinking of<br>
countries in terms of land area?  Is't it more realistic to think of<br>
countries in terms of organization, communication and resource movement? <br>
There is no reason a country must have all of it's regions physically<br>
connected, either.  So, all the Extropians around the world could say (if<br>
they wanted to) that all the land they each own will be considered a sort<br>
of distributed country.  Or we could all say that the whole world is our<br>
country, which happens to be full of other people playing their own<br>
political games and dividing up the land in their own way.  We just need<br>
to work around them and with them to achieve our goals.  In my opinion,<br>
"countries" are for the mundane, for people who can only think in<br>
simplistic terms.  I see the idea of a "country" as a relic from a dying<br>
age, as global economics blurrs and erases national borders.  I think the<br>
idea of a country is becoming less relevant to the modern world. <br>
Extropians don't need a country of our own;  I see little advantage in<br>
this.  We will have a greater impact on Humanity if we are distributed<br>
throughout the world than if we are concentrated in one small area.<br>
