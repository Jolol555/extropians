<i>&gt; "My socialist buddies in China"? I don't know anyone there except one fellow</i><br>

<i>&gt; description 'socialist' hardly fits here, though. It's a capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt; dictatorship with a red flag.</i><br>
<p>
So it isn't free enterprise, right? Its an oligopoly. They claim to be<br>
socialists as a general matter of propaganda, but so did the communists...<br>
Nothing is really different with the minor exception that they don't shoot<br>
foreign reporters as spies anymore.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; There are different conservative groups. One is the religous-right,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Republican group. You're hardly part of that group. But there's also a</i><br>
<i>&gt; group &gt;&gt; of technology freaks that argue based on ideas that were refuted a</i><br>
<i>&gt; long time &gt;&gt; ago. I call this conservative. You call it Extropy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;You should look at the political arena as more of an x/y coordinate system,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;rather than just a right left spectrum. One axis represents relative social</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;freedom, and the other represents relative economic freedom. While &gt;American</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;conservatives occupy the high economic,low social freedom &gt;corner, and nazis</i><br>
<i>&gt; and &gt;communists occupy the low economic, low social &gt;freedom corner,</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarians &gt;occupy the high, high corner, while the &gt;international</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarchists typically are &gt;in the high social, low economic &gt;corner.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Freedom, freedom, freedom. I always hear freedom. As free decision is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; myth, who is free? The perfect slave thinks he's free. Maybe the loan</i><br>
<i>&gt; slavery in capitalist countries is just much more subtle to seize, together</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the great media propaganda telling us how free we are compared to those</i><br>
<i>&gt; poor, oppressed North Koreans, Chinese, Cubans, Vietnamese (the propaganda</i><br>
<i>&gt; has, however, declined since 1991 and focused on other important issues like</i><br>
<i>&gt; the evilness of Saddam Hussain and the Serbian atrocities.)</i><br>
<p>
IMHO, only a moron takes a loan for anything that they can't get a higher rate<br>
of return on than the loan interest rate. I pay cash for anything I need.<br>
Freedom, in the words of a former US President, is "The right to choose between<br>
working and starving." Additionally, as Steve Biko has said, "the most potent<br>
weapon of the slavemaster is the mind of the slave."<br>
<p>
Take Cuba for example. Its economy is now open to most of Europe and Canada, and<br>
all the rest of the world who doesn't necessarily cowtow to US policies. Yet it<br>
is still a shithole. The claims of high life expectancy are totally false, as<br>
the government continues to repress and mismanage the economy which is now<br>
dollar driven, not peso driven, and malnutirtion is still rampant, as the<br>
pathetic agricultural sector has all but collapsed (with absolutely no help or<br>
hindrance from the US), for it is still centrally driven by a bureaucracy that<br>
still thinks along the lines of producing the maximum amount of sugar for export<br>
to a now non-existent Soviet Union.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The best definition of freedom probably comes from the anarcho-socialists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not being oppressed by power structures while, at the same time, helping to</i><br>
<i>&gt; advance evolution. Such a freedom is entirely impossible in a "free market".</i><br>
<p>
Evolution of what? And how? You cannot create change without force and the use<br>
of power. Human nature is wired against change, for the most part.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Categorizing me in with religiouys conservatives is as insulting as puttin</i><br>
<i>&gt; an &gt;anarchist in with Stalin. Please be more discrete in your definitions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You see, I have really lost the feeling for how people may react to certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; sentences. I see parallels between Extropians and religous conservatives. As</i><br>
<i>&gt; you say, they are mostly on the economic level. But decisions on this level</i><br>
<i>&gt; determine the outlook of a society.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Not a bad analogy, but possibly more renaissance, depending on what</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;characteristics of the middle ages you are referring to. If you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about free enterprise, low tax, self reliant, spirit of exploration and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;adventure, then I wont argue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirit of exploration and adventure. ROTFL. A good way to describe the &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; crusades in an advertising of the vatican.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A good way to describe the age of exploration, or of the Viking era. My own</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;family lived in Nova Scotia prior to Jamestown and the Mayflower, at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; part &gt;of the year.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are clues that the Phoenicians have reached America. The Romans</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumvented Africa. They built better ships, had generally higher</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology (besides the steam engine, electricity and their consequences,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's little they didn't have) , more social and economic freedom and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; much higher standard of living than the Middle (AKA Dark)  Ages could ever</i><br>
<p>
ROTFL to you. Having 30% of the population in slavery is NOT 'more social and<br>
economic freedom' (although to an avowed socialist, I can see why one might<br>
think so). The Roman ships were decidedly NOT better built than the Caravels and<br>
Galleons of the Middle ages, or of even the Viking ships. A Roman boat was<br>
barely able to navigate the Mediterranean, and piracy was a scourge throughout<br>
the empire that little was done to suppress, as pirates provided the main slave<br>
supply.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;attain. On the other hand, the welfare of the empire was guaranteed by the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; emperors. If the money concentration got too big, they probably tried to</i><br>
<i>&gt; redistribute it. Too bad they couldn't prevent it.</i><br>
<p>
In the empire, 'bread and cicuses' were the only thing that kept the plebes in<br>
check from revolting against the government. By 300 AD, 95% of the Roman legions<br>
were not Citizens of Rome, but Barbarian conscripts. Members of the 'Senator'<br>
class, the patricians, were legally forbidden to 'engage in commerce', could not<br>
marry outside their class, and were more likely to cut deals with barbarian<br>
hordes than to engage in battle, in the rare event that you actually got sons fo<br>
patricians to follow the early Roman command to,"come home with your sheild or<br>
on it". (Sounds kinda like the US Congress...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The Christians murdered millions, buried the knowledge of the Romans and</i><br>
<i>&gt; maintained power (and stagnation) for nearly one millenium. The Dark Ages</i><br>
<i>&gt; were the worst time this planet has ever gone through.</i><br>
<p>
On the contrary, the Church was the only thing that preserved the knowledge of<br>
the Romans.  While the Empire was stagnant, the middle ages was not caused by<br>
the church, but by the pillaging and destruction of the Mongol Hordes, the<br>
Viking incursions, and the general migratory habits of the various tribes of<br>
'barbarians' such as the Vandals, the Visigoths, the Angles, the Franks, etc.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I disagree, as the idea that the state has the right to use deadly force in</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;redistributing my property which they confiscate from me without due</i><br>
<i>&gt; process or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;proper Constitutional authority is not even worth discussing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Because you don't consider yourself as a part of the human community, but as</i><br>
<i>&gt; an isolated being which has, for some strange reasons, the right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; accumulate scarce goods and the currency necessary to acquire them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Accumulation of information, external sensors and memory, the transhuman</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'properties' you described, is OK. But in today's world, the resources must</i><br>
<i>&gt; be distributed equally in order to allow everyone to participate in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; great game of life.</i><br>
<p>
And who is gonna do that distributing, you? Sorry, in order for the transhuman<br>
to become reality, it is gonna take individuals who amass sufficient wealth to<br>
pay for the research for themselves, for the operations on themselves.<br>
Redistributing hard earned wealth to people who didnt earn it is driving us down<br>
the same 'bread and cicuses' path that the Roman Empire took.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And what is "non-transhumanist property" anyways? Just what you define it</i><br>
<i>&gt; as, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the state? Property is property. Whether it is "non-transhumanist" or not</i><br>
<i>&gt; is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;merely due to whether it is in the hands of a transhumanist or not. Nobody</i><br>
<i>&gt; else</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;has the authority to decide otherwise.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I said "non-transhuman property". By my definition, a transhuman is a being</i><br>
<i>&gt; which has already transcended, and such a being does, according to my</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge, not exist on this planet. We're still unconnected carbon bags</i><br>
<i>&gt; filled with water. As such, we are all dependant on this planet's resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Private property of goods and currency must not exist in an environment</i><br>
<i>&gt; where goods are not reproducable.</i><br>
<p>
Oh, so you are a spiritualist. Sorry, wrong list for you. A Transhuman is an<br>
individual who decides to and undertakes the individual work necessary to move<br>
beyond the common human state. There are already such transhumans around, and<br>
most don't know that the label applies to them. People like Hawking, Freidman,<br>
Dyson, Feynman, etc.<br>
<p>
There is no fixed 'goalpost' to define a human vs. transhuman state. The human<br>
race 100 years from now will consist mostly of people who we would today regard<br>
as 'transhumans', but they  would merely regard as 'human'. We would be seen as<br>
barbarians. It is analogous to the experience of an individual falling into a<br>
singularity. As the individual approaches what they thought was the 'event<br>
horizon', that 'horizon' recedes further away. A singularity is perceived to<br>
shrink as an observer gets closer to it, as the perceived event horizon shifts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Really, funny, the native Americans might have something to say about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that natural selection doesn't apply to cultural evolution, especially the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dead</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ones. So might the Nazis, the Communists, and today, the French, as their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;uncompetetive little culture is getting overrun by Americanization (as most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;other undynamic cultures are today). As tacky as you might think it is, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;current American Culture seems to presently be the most competetive culture</i><br>
<i>&gt; in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;current existence (Or North American culture, as a Canadian would say ;)).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;course that could change, and if it does, we could all be eating tofu.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's the failure, you know. The Americans didn't become a superpower</i><br>
<i>&gt; because they were so clever. They've earned a golden nose with both World</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wars, whereas the British Empire was eliminated as a superpower already</i><br>
<i>&gt; after WW I. The German economy didn't fare so well after WW II because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; politicians were so intelligent, but because it was greatly funded by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; US.</i><br>
<p>
Which, you must admit, is a far far different thing than winning a war, n'est<br>
pas? When ever in human history has a victor so completely rebuilt a former<br>
enemy (nay, three former enemies, Germany, Italy, and Japan) so that they become<br>
less than 40 years after the war, economic rivals once again? This is the genius<br>
of the generosity and magnanimity of what you call 'selfish, greedy, capitalist<br>
Amerika'. Winning a mere war was not the trick. Winning the peace was.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; History could also look completely different, if, after WW I, Germany had</i><br>
<i>&gt; decided to cooperate with Russia. Such a plan was made, by Weimar state</i><br>
<i>&gt; secretary Rathenau. Remember the contract of Rapallo? It allowed the Germans</i><br>
<i>&gt; to quit reparation payments and to build and test weapons in the SU.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately (probably), Rathenau was assassinated in 1922.</i><br>
<p>
All that would have meant would be that the US would have come into the war<br>
earlier on the side of Britain, and when we won, we would have also been able to<br>
get the damn Soviet Union out of the way then rather than 50 years later.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated two days later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968.</i><br>
<p>
Who was saying something about crackpots..?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I wouldn't call this kind of selection natural.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Human history is a long row of bad coincidences, backstabbings and battles</i><br>
<i>&gt; for power.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution is the survival of the lifeform which fits itself best into the</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment. In cultural evolution, the environment is information,</i><br>
<i>&gt; memetics, an ever-changing flux. Neither the better one nor the more</i><br>
<i>&gt; unscrupulous one will win in the end -- the end is open. Makes things a</i><br>
<i>&gt; little more exciting, doesn't it?</i><br>
<p>
So you admit that cultural evolution is "a long row of bad coincidences,<br>
backstabbings, and battle for power"? If this is so, why do you say that "power<br>
structures need to end" for human evolution to occur?<br>
