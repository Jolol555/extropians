<i>&gt;  &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;As I said above, these discussions rapidly get to an obstinate stand on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;definitions. "Preventing a person from coming into existence" is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;definitional stance unconnected with reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Now you are forcing your definition of what a human being is on us. Since</i><br>
<i>&gt; we did not agree a fertilized egg is a human we haven't agreed on what</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'reality' is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;The reality is the person in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;question has been in existence since conception and that what you call</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;"prevention" is actually murder.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, hold it! that's your reality. A 2 week old fetus is not a person in</i><br>
<i>&gt; my book, it has the potential of becoming a person. Just like a highschool</i><br>
<i>&gt; student has the potential of becoming a scientist.</i><br>
<p>
As I've stated on this and the transhuman list in the past, my own position has<br>
nothing to do with morals. I think that the average fetus is as human as the<br>
average mental defective or lobotomized mental patient (or talk show watcher, or<br>
telephone psychic friend addict). My position is strictly a matter of legality,<br>
rights, and citizenship status. Since an unborn fetus has not attained any<br>
citizenship status in any jurisdiction on the globe that the US has diplomatic<br>
relations with (since you need to be born to become a citizen), then no fetus<br>
presently has any political rights at all. Only when a child is born are rights<br>
created that need protecting, as it is now a citizen of somewhere.<br>
<p>
As adults, we all have the 'potential' to become citizens of any country on the<br>
planet, but that does not mean that we should expect to live by the laws of any<br>
jurisdiction we are not presently a citizen, resident, or diplomatically<br>
recognised legal alien visitor. Anyone who wants to protect the internet from<br>
zealots in backwater countries or states should feel the same way about this<br>
issue. Outlawing abortion is just one more example of illegal extraterritorial<br>
exercise of power that we all should fight against.<br>
