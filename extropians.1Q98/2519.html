<i>&gt; I'll answer 'Yes' [that one has a moral responsibility to minimize</i><br>
<i>&gt; human suffering]. And then I have a big problem. Because if that's so.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If that is what I say I believe... Then what am I doing waisting my</i><br>
<i>&gt; time typing E-mails when I should be clearing mines in Aghanistan or</i><br>
<i>&gt; volunteering for Medicine Sans Frontiers in Namibia?</i><br>

You probably /are/ the very best thing you can do for the future of<br>
all humanity: earning a living.  Better still if you actually own a<br>
profit-making business.  It would be a sin for you to throw away<br>
your skills to go playing in the third world unless that's actually<br>
where your skills are; comparitive advantage will put people where<br>
their skills make the most difference--and therefore, money.  If a<br>
group like the Red Cross or the Peace Corps--staffed with people<br>
who are well-suited to those tasks--wants to go there, that's great.<br>
But as has been pointed out before, Michael Milken did far more to<br>
abolish hunger and poverty in the world than Mother Theresa did.<br>
There is not a more fundamentally moral or socially responsible act<br>
than to earn profit in free trade.<br>
<p>
I believe there is, however, another responsibility that sometimes<br>
is overlooked: to actively resist, to the extent of one's ability,<br>
those forces opposed to the values of life.  I vote, for example,<br>
because if I did not, I would feel some moral complicity in whatever<br>
atrocities are committed by the government I failed to vote against.<br>
I cannot openly oppose all the tyranny I object to; I am no use to<br>
anyone in jail.  But those few bits of dissent their guns allow me--<br>
to speak, and to vote--I feel obliged to press to their limits.<br>
