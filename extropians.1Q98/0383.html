Sorry about that.  &lt;g&gt;<br>

<p>
You call an attack a "social interaction"?<br>
<p>
: even if you only insult me, you do so under the threat that I may<br>
: react violently.  Government is no worse inherently than people.<br>
<p>
It does at least two things that you, in your example scenarios, don't:<br>
it decrees rules for interactions between *others*, and it requires<br>
others to contribute to its own efforts.<br>
<p>
: I don't disagree with your view of government, but it is a very cynical<br>
: view, and loses validity if you don't apply as rigorous a cynicism to<br>
: your own dealings with others.<br>
<p>
Um, okay: next time I use or threaten force against someone who's<br>
minding his or her own business, I promise to take a very dim view of it.<br>
