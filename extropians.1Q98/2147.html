Ditto<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; This must surprise a lot of list members, who seem to take a far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; libertarian view of ethics.  Many here seem to take the view that it's OK to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do what you like, so long as you don't harm anyone else. I challenge those</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people to place a boundary around causing "harm to anyone else".</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Every action a person takes will affect every other person to some small extent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You can't live your life without causing harm to someone else. All you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; do is mitigate the degree of harm whilst promoting your objectives. I for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; one have an interest in the "rational ethics" declared in the introduction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you want to follow rational ethics, than you only have to worry about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most apparent damage done to others (or, more specifically: can I get away</i><br>
<i>&gt; with it?) "Not damaging others" should not become a mindless dogma/taboo,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that wouldn't be rational.</i><br>
<p>
The error in logic here is that the writer assumes that all influence one has on others<br>
is harmful, and that harming others is some sort of capital offense. It is not, it is<br>
more a recommended practice, more of a cultural boundary issue, than one of criminal<br>
action. It does not prhibit it, but does expect you to pay damages if the one harmed<br>
feels that would mitigate the situation.  Like wise, not all influence on others is<br>
harmful, and much may be highly beneficial, and usually educational. Of course,<br>
busybodying yourself with somebody else's life is also considered by those who value<br>
their privacy to be rather rude, and in rare instances, the death penalty seems rather<br>
appropriate. ;)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Which brings me, finally, to the point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Someone you know, rationally, carefully and thoughtfully, decides that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is time to end their life. Such an action has a number of easily</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; identifiable anti-Extropic effects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What is the right thing to do? Do you give the person their liberty, or do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you exercise your "ethics for survival and flourishing" and forcibly remove</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;From a rational ethics point of view, the choice is easy: you try to prevent</i><br>
<i>&gt; the permanent destruction of someone you care about, even if this person</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't want to be saved *at this time*. Freedom of choice does not apply</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the mentally ill, IMO, just like it doesn't apply to small children. The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational reason why someone would want to die is unbearable (mental or</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical) suffering. If this can't be cured by today's medicine, euthanasia</i><br>
<i>&gt; and cryonic suspension are in order. If the person in question is revived</i><br>
<i>&gt; at some point in the future, he will be cured of all his physical and mental</i><br>
<i>&gt; disorders, *and* he'll be hedonistically engineered so that satisfaction is</i><br>
<i>&gt; guaranteed. And on this day, he will surely thank you from saving him</i><br>
<i>&gt; from himself.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, the last thing I would want any do gooder to do is save me from myself. A drunk<br>
or addict cannot get sober solely through the actions of others, but only through the<br>
personal will to do so, nor should a person who has decided to end their lives be<br>
forcibly saved and then brainwashed by the shrink establishment into thanking people for<br>
doing so. Just as the freedom of speech means that one has the freedom to NOT speak, the<br>
right to life guarrantees that the individual has the right to decide when NOT to live,<br>
otherwise, it is no right at all.<br>
