It's true that there are an infinite number of systems, and it's also  <br>
true that due to a bad chip in my Quantum Computer I have been unable to <br>
examine each and every system individually. I have however managed to examine <br>
all the simple ones, and the vast majority of systems can be eliminated <br>
immediately because they are too complicated to be of any use.<br>
<p>
If I want to sell something, and you want to buy, we agree on a price and <br>
make the exchange, end of story. It's understandable to both of us, it's <br>
simple, it's elegant, it works. A system that was as simple as the market and <br>
worked as well, would have been found by now, and as I have not heard any <br>
reports of this interesting development, leads me to believe that it does not <br>
exist. A protocol that needs 10 years of super computer time before I can buy<br>
a can od beer is not better than the market, regardless of what it's other <br>
virtues may be.<br>
