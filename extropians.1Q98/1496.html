You may have much better luck if you add "gay" to the description.<br>
There are very few extropian women out there, and chances to recruit<br>
more anytime soon do not seem great. I think we need to clone some <br>
female<br>
extropians.<br>
<p>
- Sasha, who avoids dating the mundanes, and stays single.<br>
<p>
My Response:<br>
<p>
I love when I get the oppurtunity to play devil's advocate, and such an <br>
oppurtunity this is.<br>
<p>
Has anyone ever wondered *why* there are so few extropian females?  What <br>
does this say about extropians?    What is it, either about our <br>
philosophy (basically sound) and our communication (needs work), that is <br>
a turn off to so many women who would otherwise be sympathetic?<br>
<p>
I can think of at least 4 women who I personally know who want to live <br>
forever, increase their potential and explore the greater cosmos as much <br>
as all of us.  So why do they feel so uncomfortable when I have given <br>
them extropian writings?<br>
<p>
I'll tell you why.  Many of you will scoff at their reasons.  But your <br>
reasons for scoffing lie at the root of their distaste.  Bottome Line:  <br>
Too many extropians put too much emphasis on certain aspects of their <br>
self, particularly their reasoning abilities and scientific knowledge, <br>
at the expense of the rest of your being.  Many of you on this list have <br>
such high intelligence (the narrow one measured by IQ tests) that you <br>
have unfortuantely let the other equally important aspects of you self <br>
atrophy.<br>
<p>
I too consider myslef an extropian.  Unfortuantley I don't limit myself <br>
their.  The extropoian principles layed out by Max More are some of the <br>
best written words underlying my life philosophy.  But I have also <br>
learned how to live beyond words, and equations and abstract concepts.  <br>
There is a whole universe out their just waiting to be lived in and <br>
experienced.  At some point, many of you need to stop thinking cosmic <br>
thoughts and start living them.  How many of you excersize on a regular <br>
basis?  How many of you spend quality time outdoors *regulary*?  How <br>
many of you have gone out on a date?  If you havn't found any <br>
"extropian" women at heart, then you arn't looking in the right places.  <br>
Besides, Sasha,  who wants a clone of yourself to talk to on very <br>
specific subjects that only you are interested in?  Don't you like <br>
surprises?  Part of the joy of living and especially of being involved <br>
with another person is the surprises they offer you in ideas and <br>
perspectives.   Take a chance - date somebody who is *not* an extropian <br>
- you might be surprised that they really are, they just approach it <br>
from a very different semantic point of view.  This has been my <br>
experience.<br>
<p>
A true extropian philosophy embraces surprise, novelty, and fresh <br>
perspectives.  Meeting people can be scarry - but as extropians can we <br>
afford to be scared?  Isn't our philosophy all about surpassing such <br>
limiting states as fear of the opposite sex?<br>
<p>
--&gt; A true extropian philosphy is one that should appeal to both sexes <br>
equally- a transexual philosophy..  Since it isn't, perhaps we need to <br>
re-asses how it can.  IMHO, a future without a womens touch is no future <br>
at all.<br>
<p>
Warm Regards,<br>
