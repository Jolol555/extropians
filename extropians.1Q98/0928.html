Tipler's ideas (in _The Physics of Immortality_) depended on the universe<br>
being closed, so that it would re-collapse upon itself, with ubiquitous<br>
life modifying the way it collapsed so that an essentially infinite<br>
amount of energy could be harnessed by life.  Now, with the news that the<br>
universe is open and will expand forever (with 95% certainty), it seems<br>
there is no hope for Tipler's ideas to come to pass.<br>
<p>
But did his ideas really require that the *entire* universe collapse into<br>
a singularity?  Or would it work if only a sufficiently large,<br>
life-filled part of it collapsed into a singularity?  What if life does,<br>
as Nick Bostrom suggested, send devices out into the universe which send<br>
matter back to some area.  If enough is sent back, the mass will collapse<br>
into a black hole.  If life organizes this right, will it be able to<br>
accomplish Tipler's ideas?  Is there enough energy in the creation of<br>
this singularity to simulate a universe of infinite (subjective) length,<br>
as Tipler proposes there would be if the entire universe collapsed?<br>
