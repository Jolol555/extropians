<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; However there is a fundamental problem with gravity shielding,</i><br>

<i>&gt; sheild x amount of gravity would be more than the e/t that could be generated</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the bias in the field, thus it would still need an external source of</i><br>
<i>&gt; additionally energy to keep from running down.</i><br>
<p>
So what people are really talking about is a "force field" rather than<br>
a gravity shield. I have tried coming up with a "reasonable" gravity<br>
shield for some science fiction games, but it stumbles on the fact<br>
that once you set up such a shield you could put in as many<br>
gravity-driven devices (like a wheel with one side lighter than the<br>
other) as you want and extract an arbitrary amount of energy from the<br>
shield, even if they are very remote. <br>
<p>
I'm very sceptical of this area, I don't see how it could be made to<br>
fit with what we know of general relativity.<br>
