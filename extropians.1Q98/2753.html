<p>
Even if its relavit velocity is less than a few hundred miles per hour, if it were<br>
on an intercept course, the earth's gravity as it approached would accelerate it<br>
to the point that it would be traveling at around 25,000 mph when it hit.<br>
<p>
Being a mile wide, it will be spending too little time in the atmosphere at that<br>
speed for it to slow down very much at all.<br>
<p>
Don't beleive me? Ask James Rogers, or check the list archives. There was an epic<br>
battle on the subject of using  moonrocks and asteroids as weapons in a Moon-Earth<br>
war here a year or two ago(maybe it wason the transhuman list?). John kindly<br>
concured on the usefullness of such large objects. That we now know that there are<br>
at least 100 such large objects that will pass within 1/10th of an astronomical<br>
unit, at least once each in the next 33 years indicates indicates that lunar<br>
rebels will not need the use of  a mass launcher to threaten Earth with. There are<br>
plenty of much bigger rocks up there already that are passing by, just ready to be<br>
steered off course.<br>
