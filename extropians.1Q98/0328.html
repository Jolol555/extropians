<i>&gt; Anyone know the validity of the story that drinking seawater makes you crazy?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do people survive on a raft by drinking seawater, or do they have to catch</i><br>
<i>&gt; rainwater?  Maybe not drinking enough (sea)water makes them crazy?</i><br>
<p>
There is a limit to the concentration of salt in drinking water that the body<br>
can handle. At the levels in sea water, if you drink enough of it to satisfy<br>
your need for water, the salt will be more than you can handle (I'm not <br>
certain what the various symptoms are, but delirium wouldn't be too surprising<br>
from the effects on membrane ion potentials). Too much salt will definitely <br>
induce nausea, which is not a good thing when you are thirsting.<br>
Sea water is only somewhat more salty than the body can handle, so in a <br>
survival situation, you can double your available water by diluting sea water <br>
50-50 with pure drinking water.<br>
I would guess that it wouldn't give you quite the good of an actual doubling<br>
of the amount of pure water, as the body has to fight to deal with the extra <br>
salt, even if it's within the tolerance level.<br>
