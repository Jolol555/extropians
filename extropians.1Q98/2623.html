Many would agree with that, while disagreeing with you and me as to<br>
what's<br>
wrong with the average conscience.<br>

<i>&gt; I did get it right.  They were constitutionally less than fully human.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then, after the Civil War, they were constitutionally, hey presto! fully</i><br>
<i>&gt; human.  Purely a matter of defining human, just as the abortion matter is.</i><br>
<p>
Agreed, though I doubt it was thought of in such terms at the time.<br>
We've grown up with a culture whose sacred cows include the equality <br>
(in some sense) of every human; but our great-grandparents saw no <br>
contradiction in the two sentences "Joe is as human as I am" and <br>
"Joe is my inferior," because it was accepted that some kinds of<br>
human are indeed inferior.  Or so it seems to me.  Has anyone here<br>
read enough 19C opinion to have a good idea what *they* understood<br>
"that all men are created equal" to mean?<br>
<p>
I meant only that the 3/5 rule has nothing to do with measuring degrees <br>
of humanity.  After all, a slave could be emancipated, and then hey<br>
presto <br>
he was counted as equal to a white man for purposes of apportionment,<br>
but still he had some legal disabilities almost everywhere -- like a<br>
white woman in both respects.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have never claimed that genetics is a criterion for personhood. </i><br>
<i>&gt; The moment the self begins to develop is what defines human.</i><br>
<p>
And I say that begins (in humans) some time after birth.  What goes on<br>
before is just the building of a generic foundation.  Has a newborn<br>
human<br>
as much individuality as a new-hatched chicken?<br>
<p>
What do you mean by "the self"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; : If it is legitimate for the strong to prey upon the weak, sooner or</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; : later, we will end up, not as a society, but as isolated systems of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; : perfected self-defense staring at each other across no-man's land.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This resembles Ayn Rand's argument against polycentric law. </i><br>
<p>
Oops, I hope nobody thought I was imputing the next two sentences to<br>
Rand.<br>
They're wholly mine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Might does make right, but there are many kinds of might, and some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the most important are impersonal - the laws of nature itself.  Ability</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to attract the sympathy of the strong is also a kind of might.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Interesting observation about Rand, I hadn't thought of it that way.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; like what Pascal said, might makes right so let's make sure the mighty are</i><br>
<i>&gt; right.  Ability to attract sympathy is important, another way of saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is that fraternity and equality are utterly imcompatible ideals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Fraternity must trump equality for society to avoid the isolated systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; result.  Polycentrism is closer to fraternity than to equality.</i><br>
<p>
Interesting, but I don't grok what you mean by "fraternity" and how <br>
it is incompatible with equality.  Would you expand and/or paraphrase?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; It's not that I "cannot begin to understand" your position on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; abortion; I believe I understand it, but I also believe it's based on</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; either an error of fact or an arational preference - in either case, not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; binding on anyone else.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Supreme Court's arational preference or error of fact is binding</i><br>
<i>&gt; on all those who define human the way I have.  It is tyranny of a most</i><br>
<i>&gt; brutal kind.</i><br>
<p>
And in a polycentric order, what would be different?  Would you not<br>
still<br>
have neighbors wantonly disagreeing with your definitions?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; A number of time travel stories touch on the tragedy of erasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; someone (a child, a lover, a hero) from history by preventing their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; conception.  Whether that amounts to murder is an interesting question.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Time travel is ridiculous.  The staggering number of murders occurring</i><br>
<i>&gt; here and now is what's interesting.</i><br>
<p>
Then I withdraw the fanciful metaphor.  My first draft put it this way:<br>
You said that if Mrs O'Connor had had an abortion then our Max,<br>
not a "precursor" of miscellaneous tissue, would have been murdered.<br>
But if Mr &amp; Mrs O'Connor had used effective contraception, Max More <br>
would be just as absent from our world.  Would that be any less murder?<br>
"Every sperm is sacred..."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...]  In Oregon, the logic of the statist establishment of</i><br>
<i>&gt; death-worshipping as the official religion means that my tax dollars are</i><br>
<i>&gt; now being reallocated to the poor so they can pay a doctor to murder them</i><br>
<i>&gt; on demand.  I am soiled by this [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt;  48% of Oregon voters, including me, voted against doctor-assisted suicide,</i><br>
<i>&gt; aka, licensing doctors to murder.  [...]</i><br>
<p>
I agree that making you pay for it is intolerably cruel.<br>
But it's absurd to call it murder when done at the victim's request.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...] the core ethics of Western Civilization that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked well for centuries on end, namely, humans are not to be used as</i><br>
<i>&gt; means because they are ends in themselves.  [...]</i><br>
<p>
I dunno about you, but I use other humans as means every day: <br>
I call it trade.<br>
